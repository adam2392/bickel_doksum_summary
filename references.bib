abstract = {Objective To examine the relationship between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the presence of preoperative seizures, World Health Organization tumor grade, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational status in gliomas. Methods We retrospectively studied intraoperative electrocorticography recorded in 16 patients with brain tumor (12 presenting with seizures) who underwent awake craniotomy and surgical resection between September 2016 and June 2017. The number and distribution of HFOs were determined and quantified visually and with an automated HFO detector. Results Five patients had low-grade (1 with grade I and 4 with grade II) and 11 had high-grade (6 with grade III and 5 with grade IV) brain tumors. An IDH1 mutation was found in 6 patients. Patients with a history of preoperative seizures were more likely to have HFOs than those without preoperative seizures (9 of 12 vs 0 of 4, p = 0.02). The rate of HFOs was higher in patients with IDH1 mutant (mean 7.2 per minute) than IDH wild-type (mean 2.3 per minute) genotype (p = 0.03). Conclusions HFOs are common in brain tumor-related epilepsy, and HFO rate may be a useful measure of epileptogenicity in gliomas. Our findings further support the notion that IDH1 mutant genotype is more epileptogenic than IDH1 wild-type genotype gliomas.},

abstract = {In epilepsy, brain networks generate pathological high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs) during interictal periods. To understand how pHFOs differ from normal oscillations in overlapping frequency bands and potentially perturb hippocampal processing, we performed high-density single unit and local field potential recordings from hippocampi of behaving rats with and without chronic epilepsy. In epileptic animals, we observed two types of co-occurring fast oscillations, which by comparison to control animals we could classify as ‘ripple-like' or ‘pHFO'. We compared their spectral characteristics, brain state dependence, and cellular participants. Strikingly, pHFO occurred irrespective of brain state, were associated with interictal spikes, engaged distinct subnetworks of principal neurons compared to ripple-like events, increased the sparsity of network activity, and initiated both general and immediate disruptions in spatial information coding. Taken together, our findings suggest that events that result in pHFOs have an immediate impact on memory processes, corroborating the need for proper classification of pHFOs to facilitate therapeutic interventions that selectively target pathological activity.},

abstract = {Objective: We hypothesized that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) with irregular amplitude and frequency more specifically reflect epileptogenicity than HFOs with stable amplitude and frequency. Methods: We developed a fully automatic algorithm to detect HFOs and classify them based on their morphology, with types defined according to regularity in amplitude and frequency: type 1 with regular amplitude and frequency; type 2 with irregular amplitude, which could result from filtering of sharp spikes; type 3 with irregular frequency; and type 4 with irregular amplitude and frequency. We investigated the association of different HFO types with the seizure onset zone (SOZ), resected area and surgical outcome. Results: HFO rates of all types were significantly higher inside the SOZ than outside. HFO types 1 and 2 were strongly correlated to each other and showed the highest rates among all HFOs. Their occurrence was highly associated with the SOZ, resected area and surgical outcome. The automatic detection emulated visual markings with 93{\%} true positives and 57{\%} false detections. Conclusions: HFO types 1 and 2 similarly reflect epileptogenicity. Significance: For clinical application, it may not be necessary to separate real HFOs from "false oscillations" produced by the filter effect of sharp spikes. Also for automatically detected HFOs, surgical outcome is better when locations with higher HFO rates are included in the resection.},

abstract = {Little is known about the ethnic and racial differences in the prevalence of generalized and focal epilepsy among patients with non-acquired epilepsies. In this study, we examined epilepsy classification and race/ethnicity in 813 probands from sibling or parent-child pairs with epilepsy enrolled in the Epilepsy Genome/Phenome Project (EPGP). Subjects were classified as generalized epilepsy (GE), non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE), mixed epilepsy syndrome (both generalized and focal), and unclassifiable, based on consensus review of semiology and available clinical, electrophysiology, and neuroimaging data. In this cohort, 628 (77.2{\%}) subjects identified exclusively as Caucasian/white and 65 (8.0{\%}) subjects reported African ancestry, including subjects of mixed-race. Of the Caucasian/white subjects, 357 (56.8{\%}) had GE, 207 (33.0{\%}) had NAFE, 32 (5.1{\%}) had a mixed syndrome, and 32 (5.1{\%}) were unclassifiable. Among subjects of African ancestry, 28 (43.1{\%}) had GE, 27 (41.5{\%}) had NAFE, 2 (3.1{\%}) had a mixed syndrome, and 8 (12.3{\%}) were unclassifiable. There was a higher proportion of subjects with GE compared to other syndromes among Caucasians/whites compared to subjects with African ancestry (OR 1.74, 95{\%} CI: 1.04-2.92, two-tailed Fisher's exact test, p= 0.036). There was no difference in the rate of GE among subjects reporting Hispanic ethnicity (7.6{\%} of total) when adjusted for race (Caucasian/white vs non-Caucasian/white; OR 0.65, 95{\%} CI: 0.40-1.06, p {\textgreater} 0.05). The proportion of participants with unclassifiable epilepsy was significantly greater in those of African-American descent. In a group of patients with epilepsy of unknown etiology and an affected first degree relative, GE is more common among Caucasian/white subjects than among those with African ancestry. These findings suggest there may be geographical differences in the distribution of epilepsy susceptibility genes and an effect of genetic background on epilepsy phenotype. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the low numbers of African-Americans in this cohort and more limited diagnostic data available for epilepsy classification in these subjects compared to Caucasians/whites. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The mainstay of therapy for epilepsy is anti-seizure drugs (ASDs, also referred to as anticonvulsants and anti-epileptic medications). Through much of the past century, only a handful for ASDs were available for clinical use. However, with the creation of the U.S. National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)–sponsored Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP), coupled with the emergence of high-throughput screening platforms and methodologies, and advances in our understanding of the fundamental neurobiology of epilepsy, ASD development has greatly accelerated over the past 25 years. More than 18 new ASDs have been approved for clinical use since the inception of the ASP. Despite this remarkable success and the emergence of drugs possessing more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles that act on novel molecular targets, there has been increasing recognition that the paradigms for drug discovery have not yielded significant improvements in therapeutic efficacy, and that disease modification (i.e., anti-epileptogenesis), among other challenges, must be addressed. Thus, with the renewed framework and mission of improving the lives of people with epilepsy, the name of the ASP was changed to the Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP). This review briefly summarizes the history of ASD development and outlines some of the challenges and opportunities for the next generation of drug therapies for the epilepsy field.},

abstract = {Classical supervised learning produces unreliable models when training and target distributions differ, with most existing solutions requiring samples from the target domain. We propose a proactive approach which learns a relationship in the training domain that will generalize to the target domain by incorporating prior knowledge of aspects of the data generating process that are expected to differ as expressed in a causal selection diagram. Specifically, we remove variables generated by unstable mechanisms from the joint factorization to yield the Surgery Estimator---an interventional distribution that is invariant to the differences across environments. We prove that the surgery estimator finds stable relationships in strictly more scenarios than previous approaches which only consider conditional relationships, and demonstrate this in simulated experiments. We also evaluate on real world data for which the true causal diagram is unknown, performing competitively against entirely data-driven approaches.},

Instead of using samples from the target distribution to reactively correct dataset shift, we use graphical knowledge of the causal mechanisms relating variables in a prediction problem to proactively remove relationships that do not generalize across environments, even when these relationships may depend on unobserved variables (violations of the "no unobserved confounders" assumption). To accomplish this, we identify variables with unstable paths of statistical influence and remove them from the model. We also augment the causal graph with latent counterfactual variables that isolate unstable paths of statistical influence, allowing us to retain stable paths that would otherwise be removed. Our experiments demonstrate that models that remove vulnerable variables and use estimates of the latent variables transfer better, often outperforming in the target domain despite some accuracy loss in the training domain.},

abstract = {Gamma waves, defined as rhythms from 25 to 100 Hz, are reviewed along with fast (100-400 Hz) and ultrafast (400-800 Hz) activity. Investigations on animals, especially those involving interneurons from the hippocampus, are reviewed. Gamma waves and fast rhythms likely play a role in neural communication, reflecting information from the external world to the brain. These rhythms become evident when the GABA-A system shifts from excitation to inhibition; are seen mainly in the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, and CA1-CA3 system; and are likely involved in long-term memory and cognitive task performance. These waves are also involved in spreading depression, but especially with epileptiform activity, progressively increasing in frequency from the pre-ictal to the ictal state. After status epilepticus, their presence predicts the development of spontaneous seizures. Gamma waves and fast activity have been studied in all sensory modalities, especially visual systems, providing a mechanism for awareness and processing of visual objects. In humans, gamma waves develop in the young, peak at 4-5 years of age, and are observed especially during alertness and after sensory stimulation. These fast rhythms are seen in the majority of seizures, especially in infantile spasms and during ictal activity in extratemporal and regional onsets, and, if low in amplitude, seem to be a good prognostic sign after seizure surgery. They have been studied in all sensory systems and are associated with selective attention, transient binding of cognitive features, and conscious perception of the external world. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In ∼20 million people with drug-resistant epilepsy, focal seizures originating in dysfunctional brain networks will often evolve and spread to surrounding tissue, disrupting function in otherwise normal brain regions. To identify network control mechanisms that regulate seizure spread, we developed a novel tool for pinpointing brain regions that facilitate synchronization in the epileptic network. Our method measures the impact of virtually resecting putative control regions on synchronization in a validated model of the human epileptic network. By applying our technique to time-varying functional networks, we identified brain regions whose topological role is to synchronize or desynchronize the epileptic network. Our results suggest that greater antagonistic push-pull interaction between synchronizing and desynchronizing brain regions better constrains seizure spread. These methods, while applied here to epilepsy, are generalizable to other brain networks and have wide applicability in isolating and mapping functional drivers of brain dynamics in health and disease.},

abstract = {Objectives: To analyze interictal High frequency oscillations (HFOs) as observed in the medial temporal lobe of epileptic patients and animals (ripples, 80-200 Hz and fast ripples, 250-600 Hz). To show that the identification of interictal HFOs raises some methodological issues, as the filtering of sharp transients (e.g., epileptic spikes or artefacts) or signals with harmonics can result in "false" ripples. To illustrate and quantify the occurrence of false ripples on filtered EEG traces. Methods: We have performed high-pass filtering on both simulated and real data. We have also used two alternate methods: time-frequency analysis and matching pursuit. Results: Two types of events were shown to produce oscillations after filtering that could be confounded with actual oscillatory activity: sharp transients and harmonics of non-sinusoidal signals. Conclusions: High-pass filtering of EEG traces for detection of oscillatory activity should be performed with great care. Filtered traces should be compared to original traces for verification of presence of transients. Additional techniques such as time-frequency transforms or sparse decompositions are highly beneficial. Significance: Our study draws the attention on an issue of great importance in the marking of HFOs on EEG traces. We illustrate complementary methods that can help both researchers and clinicians. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Purpose: To estimate the burden of lifetime epilepsy (LTE) and active epilepsy (AE) and examine the influence of study characteristics on prevalence estimates. Methods: We searched online databases and identified articles using prespecified criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the median prevalence in developed countries and in urban and rural settings in developing countries. The impact of study characteristics on prevalence estimates was determined using meta-regression models. Results: The median LTE prevalence for developed countries was 5.8 per 1,000 (5th-95th percentile range 2.7-12.4) compared to 15.4 per 1,000 (4.8-49.6) for rural and 10.3 (2.8-37.7) for urban studies in developing countries. The median prevalence of AE was 4.9 per 1,000 (2.3-10.3) for developed countries and 12.7 per 1,000 (3.5-45.5) and 5.9 (3.4-10.2) in rural and urban studies in developing countries. The estimates of burden for LTE and AE in developed countries were 6.8 million (5th-95th percentile range 3.2-14.7) and 5.7 million (2.7-12.2), respectively. In developing countries these were 45 (14-145) million LTE and 17 (10-133) million AE in rural areas and 17 (5-61) million LTE and 10 (5-17) million AE in urban areas. Studies involving all ages or only adults showed higher estimates than pediatric studies. Higher prevalence estimates were also associated with rural location and small study size. Conclusions: This study estimates the global burden of epilepsy and the proportions with AE, which may benefit from treatment. There are systematic differences in reported prevalence estimates, which are only partially explained by study characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2010 International League Against Epilepsy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To develop estimates of the direct cost of epilepsy in the United States for the general epilepsy population and sub-populations by systematically comparing similarities and differences in types of estimates and estimation methods from recently published studies. METHODS Papers published since 1995 were identified by systematic literature search. Information on types of estimates, study designs, data sources, types of epilepsy, and estimation methods was extracted from each study. Annual per person cost estimates from methodologically similar studies were identified, converted to 2013 U.S. dollars, and compared. RESULTS From 4,104 publications discovered in the literature search, 21 were selected for review. Three were added that were published after the search. Eighteen were identified that reported estimates of average annual direct costs for the general epilepsy population in the United States. For general epilepsy populations (comprising all clinically defined subgroups), total direct healthcare costs per person ranged from {\$}10,192 to {\$}47,862 and epilepsy-specific costs ranged from {\$}1,022 to {\$}19,749. Four recent studies using claims data from large general populations yielded relatively similar epilepsy-specific annual cost estimates ranging from {\$}8,412 to {\$}11,354. Although more difficult to compare, studies examining direct cost differences for epilepsy sub-populations indicated a consistent pattern of markedly higher costs for those with uncontrolled or refractory epilepsy, and for those with comorbidities. SIGNIFICANCE This systematic review found that various approaches have been used to estimate the direct costs of epilepsy in the United States. However, recent studies using large claims databases and similar methods allow estimation of the direct cost burden of epilepsy for the general disease population, and show that it is greater for some patient subgroups. Additional research is needed to further understand the broader economic burden of epilepsy and how it varies across subpopulations.},

@article{DeFelipe1999,
abstract = {The main goal of this article is to review certain aspects of the circuitry of the human cerebral cortex that may be particularly relevant for the development, maintenance or spread of seizures. There are a number of different structural abnormalities that are commonly found in the cortex of epileptic patients, but these abnormalities do not appear to be intrinsically epileptogenic, since some patients displaying them are epileptic (after variable delays) whereas others are not. Therefore, cortical circuits in an affected brain may undergo a series of changes that finally cause epilepsy. In this article, it is proposed that the chandelier cell, which is considered to be the most powerful cortical GABAergic inhibitory interneuron, is probably a key component of cortical circuits in the establishment of human intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. These cells (among other types) have been found to be lost or reduced at epileptic foci in both experimental animals and epileptic patients. A hypothesis is presented by which the normal variability in the number of interneurons might explain the predisposition of some individuals to develop epilepsy more than others as a result of a lesion or other precipitating factors that lead to loss of neurons. The sources of GABAergic input on dendrites and somata of cortical pyramidal cells originate from many and diverse types of interneurons but, at the level of the axon initial segment of these cells, all synapses come from a few chandelier cells (five or less). Loss of one class of interneurons ending on soma and dendrites might have relatively little impact on the inhibitory control of the pyramidal cell. However, if chandelier cells were affected, it would have serious consequences for the inhibitory control of the pyramidal cells. Evidence suggests that the loss of chandelier cells may be nonspecific and that when this occurs epilepsy may develop. Therefore, these cells might represent a key component in the aetiology of human temporal lobe epilepsy.},

@article{Ehrens2015a,
abstract = {It has recently been proposed that the epileptic cortex is fragile in the sense that seizures manifest through small perturbations in the synaptic connections that render the entire cortical network unstable. Closed-loop therapy could therefore entail detecting when the network goes unstable, and then stimulating with an exogenous current to stabilize the network. In this study, a non-linear stochastic model of a neuronal network was used to simulate both seizure and non-seizure activity. In particular, synaptic weights between neurons were chosen such that the network's fixed point is stable during non-seizure periods, and a subset of these connections (the most fragile) were perturbed to make the same fixed point unstable to model seizure events; and, the model randomly transitions between these two modes. The goal of this study was to measure spike train observations from this epileptic network and then apply a feedback controller that (i) detects when the network goes unstable, and then (ii) applies a state-feedback gain control input to the network to stabilize it. The stability detector is based on a 2-state (stable, unstable) hidden Markov model (HMM) of the network, and detects the transition from the stable mode to the unstable mode from using the firing rate of the most fragile node in the network (which is the output of the HMM). When the unstable mode is detected, a state-feedback gain is applied to generate a control input to the fragile node bringing the network back to the stable mode. Finally, when the network is detected as stable again, the feedback control input is switched off. High performance was achieved for the stability detector, and feedback control suppressed seizures within 2 s after onset.},

abstract = {High-frequency oscillations (HFO; gamma: 40-100 Hz, ripples: 100-200 Hz, and fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) have been widely studied in health and disease. These phenomena may serve as biomarkers for epileptic brain; however, a means of differentiating between pathological and normal physiological HFO is essential. We categorized task-induced physiological HFO during periods of HFO induced by a visual or motor task by measuring frequency, duration, and spectral amplitude of each event in single trial time-frequency spectra and compared them to pathological HFO similarly measured. Pathological HFO had higher mean spectral amplitude, longer mean duration, and lower mean frequency than physiological-induced HFO. In individual patients, support vector machine analysis correctly classified pathological HFO with sensitivities ranging from 70-98{\%} and specificities {\textgreater}90{\%} in all but one patient. In this patient, infrequent high-amplitude HFO were observed in the motor cortex just before movement onset in the motor task. This finding raises the possibility that in epileptic brain physiological-induced gamma can assume higher spectral amplitudes similar to those seen in pathologic HFO. This method if automated and validated could provide a step towards differentiating physiological HFO from pathological HFO and improving localization of epileptogenic brain.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is a common outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the mechanisms of posttraumatic epileptogenesis are poorly understood. One clue is the occurrence of selective hippocampal cell death after fluid-percussion TBI in rats, consistent with the reported reduction of hippocampal volume bilaterally in humans after TBI and resembling hippocampal sclerosis, a hallmark of temporal-lobe epilepsy. Other features of temporal-lobe epilepsy, such as long-term seizure susceptibility, persistent hyperexcitability in the dentate gyrus (DG), and mossy fiber synaptic reorganization, however, have not been examined after TBI. To determine whether TBI induces these changes, we used a well studied model of TBI by weight drop on somatosensory cortex in adult rats. First, we confirmed an early and selective cell loss in the hilus of the DG and area CA3 of hippocampus, ipsilateral to the impact. Second, we found persistently enhanced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions 15 weeks after TBI. Third, by applying GABA(A) antagonists during field-potential and optical recordings in hippocampal slices 3 and 15 weeks after TBI, we unmasked a persistent, abnormal APV-sensitive hyperexcitability that was bilateral and localized to the granule cell and molecular layers of the DG. Finally, using Timm histochemistry, we detected progressive sprouting of mossy fibers into the inner molecular layers of the DG bilaterally 2-27 weeks after TBI. These findings are consistent with the development of posttraumatic epilepsy in an animal model of impact head injury, showing a striking similarity to the enduring behavioral, functional, and structural alterations associated with temporal-lobe epilepsy.},

An automated HFO detector and blind source separation are applied to nearly 3000 total hours of data from 121 subjects, including 12 control subjects without epilepsy. Although interictal HFOs are significantly correlated with the seizure onset zone, the precise localization is consistent in only 22{\%} of patients. The remaining patients either have one intermittent source (16{\%}), different sources varying over time (45{\%}), or insufficient HFOs (17{\%}). Multiple HFO networks are found in patients with both one and multiple seizure foci. These results indicate that robust HFO interpretation requires prolonged analysis in context with other clinical data, rather than isolated review of short data segments.},

Symptomatic temporal lobe epilepsy can be further divided into mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the condition associated with hippocampal sclerosis; lesional temporal lobe epilepsy due to specific identifiable lesions localized to areas that preferentially project to mesial temporal structures; and cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy, for which no etiology can be determined. Intensive clinical and basic research on MTLE, perhaps the most common form of human epilepsy, is currently being carried out in epilepsy research centers, and a number of mental animal models have now been developed to help elucidate the pathophysiology of this condition. Animal models are also important for determining how specific lesions induce epileptogenicity, and whether the neuronal mechanisms in mesial temporal lobe limbic structures are the same as those in neocortex. Cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy remains a major clinical challenge, and much more information needs to be derived from research on patients before relevant experimental animal models can be created.},

As the BIDS-iEEG extension has received input from many iEEG researchers, it provides a common ground for data transfer within labs, between labs, and in open-data repositories. It will facilitate reproducible analyses across datasets, experiments, and recording sites, allowing scientists to answer more complex questions about the human brain.

There was a signiﬁcant seizure reduction with the stimulator ‘‘on'' versus ‘‘off'' during several months after stimulator implantation. The hippocampus as stimulation target has not yet been studied in a large randomized trial. Responsive stimulation applies a stimulus whenever epileptiform activity occurs. It requires online detection of epileptiform activity. This concept is based on the observation that epileptiform activity during functional mapping can be aborted by brief pulses of cortical stimulation. Current technology is able to detect seizure activity intracranially on-line and delivers a high frequency stimulus if epileptiform activity is detected. A large randomized multicenter trial has been conducted testing this system for focal epilepsy.},

In order to achieve a desirable tradeoff between the quality of approximation and the number of modes that are used to approximate the given fields, we develop a sparsity-promoting variant of the standard DMD algorithm. Sparsity is induced by regularizing the least-squares deviation between the matrix of snapshots and the linear combination of DMD modes with an additional term that penalizes the l1-norm of the vector of DMD amplitudes. The globally optimal solution of the resulting regularized convex optimization problem is computed using the alternating direction method of multipliers, an algorithm well-suited for large problems. Several examples of flow fields resulting from numerical simulations and physical experiments are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

For this reason, we call observed curves and images 'functional data,' and statistical methods for analyzing such data are described by the term 'functional data analysis.' It is the smoothness of the processes generating functional data that differentiates this type of data from more classical multivariate observations. This smoothness means that we can work with the information in the derivatives of functions or images. This article includes several illustrative examples.},

abstract = {Methods of evaluating and comparing the performance of diagnostic tests are of increasing importance as new tests are developed and marketed. When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The curve is constructed by varying the cutpoint used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive rates. When two or more empirical curves are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between curves must take into account the correlated nature of the data. This paper presents a nonparametric approach to the analysis of areas under correlated ROC curves, by using the theory on generalized U-statistics to generate an estimated covariance matrix.},

abstract = {Background: There is a broad need in neuroscience to understand and visualize large-scale recordings of neural activity, big data acquired by tens or hundreds of electrodes recording dynamic brain activity over minutes to hours. Such datasets are characterized by coherent patterns across both space and time, yet existing computational methods are typically restricted to analysis either in space or in time separately. New method: Here we report the adaptation of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), an algorithm originally developed for studying fluid physics, to large-scale neural recordings. DMD is a modal decomposition algorithm that describes high-dimensional dynamic data using coupled spatial-temporal modes. The algorithm is robust to variations in noise and subsampling rate; it scales easily to very large numbers of simultaneously acquired measurements. Results: We first validate the DMD approach on sub-dural electrode array recordings from human subjects performing a known motor task. Next, we combine DMD with unsupervised clustering, developing a novel method to extract spindle networks during sleep. We uncovered several distinct sleep spindle networks identifiable by their stereotypical cortical distribution patterns, frequency, and duration. Comparison with existing methods: DMD is closely related to principal components analysis (PCA) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We may think of DMD as a rotation of the low-dimensional PCA space such that each basis vector has coherent dynamics. Conclusions: The resulting analysis combines key features of performing PCA in space and power spectral analysis in time, making it particularly suitable for analyzing large-scale neural recordings.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

Recent evidence has shown that spontaneous HFOs can be recorded from the scalp, but detection of these electrographic events remains a challenge. Here, we modified a simple automatic detector, used originally for intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, to detect ripples and fast ripples in scalp EEG. We analyzed scalp EEG recordings of seven subjects and validated our detector and artifact rejection algorithm via visual review. Of the candidate events marked by the detector, 40{\%} and 60{\%} were confirmed to be ripples and fast ripples, respectively, by human visual review, making this algorithm suitable for supervised detection. Detected HFOs occurred at a rate of {\textless}1/min in most channels, and the average duration was 47 and 24 ms for ripples and fast ripples, respectively. The simplicity of the algorithm, with only a single parameter, enables the consistent application of automatic detection across recording modalities, and it could therefore be a tool for the assessment and localization of epileptic activity.},

abstract = {High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epileptic tissue, but detection of these electrographic events remains a challenge. Auto- matic detectors show encouraging results, but they typi- cally require optimization of multiple parameters, which is a barrier to good performance and broad applicability. We therefore propose a new automatic HFO detection algo- rithm, focusing on simplicity and ease of implementation. It requires tuning of only an amplitude threshold, which can be determined by an iterative process or directly cal- culated from statistics of the rectified filtered data (i.e. mean plus standard deviation). The iterative approach uses an estimate of the amplitude probability distribution of the background activity to calculate the optimum threshold for identification of transient high amplitude events. We tested both the iterative and non-iterative approaches using a dataset of visually marked HFOs, and we compared the performance to a commonly used detector based on the root-mean-square. When the threshold was optimized for individual channels via ROC curve, all three methods were comparable. The iterative detector achieved a sensitivity of 99.6{\%}, false positive rate (FPR) of 1.1{\%}, and false detec- tion rate (FDR) of 37.3{\%}. However, in an eight-fold cross- validation test, the iterative method had better sensitivity than the other two methods (80.0{\%} compared to 64.4 and 65.8{\%}), with FPR and FDR of 1.3, and 49.4{\%}, respectively. The simplicity of this algorithm, with only a single param- eter, will enable consistent application of automatic detec- tion across research centers and recording modalities, and it may therefore be a powerful tool for the assessment and localization of epileptic activity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Scheduled and responsive direct brain stimulation may be an effective and safe therapy for medically intractable epilepsy. RECENT FINDINGS: Scheduled stimulation (open loop) has been provided via electrodes implanted in thalamic nuclei, the cerebellum and the hippocampus using devices commercially available for treatment of tremor and Parkinson's disease. Small pilot trials suggest that seizure frequency is reduced in some patients with intractable epilepsy. Responsive stimulation requires systems that detect abnormal electrographic activity and provide stimulation (closed loop). Studies in inpatients and outpatients suggest that abnormal electrographic discharges can be detected before there is evolution into a clinical seizure, and that focal stimulation of the epileptogenic region terminates electrographic seizures and reduces the frequency of clinically evident seizures. SUMMARY: Direct brain stimulation appears to be safe and may be efficacious in treating medically intractable epilepsy. The optimal location (deep brain or cortical) and characteristics of the stimulation (frequency, current, duration), and whether stimulation should be focal or responsive are still to be determined. If ongoing studies of a deep brain stimulator and of a cranially implanted responsive neurostimulator demonstrate effectiveness, then neurostimulation may become available as adjunctive therapy for medically intractable epilepsy.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological experiments in the partial cortical isolation (“undercut” or “UC”) model of injury-induced neocortical epileptogenesis have shown alterations in GABAergic synaptic transmission attributable to abnormalities in presynaptic terminals. To determine whether the decreased inhibition was associated with structural abnormalities in GABAergic interneurons, we used immunocytochemical techniques, confocal microscopy and EM in UC and control sensorimotor rat cortex to analyze structural alterations in fast-spiking parvalbumin-containing interneurons and pyramidal (Pyr) cells of layer V. Principle findings were: 1) there were no decreases in counts of parvalbumin (PV)- or GABA-immunoreactive interneurons in UC cortex, however there were significant reductions in expression of VGAT and GAD-65 and -67 in halos of GABAergic terminals around Pyr somata in layer V. 2) Consistent with previous results, somatic size and density of Pyr cells was decreased in infragranular layers of UC cortex. 3) Dendrites of biocytin-filled FS interneurons were significantly decreased in volume. 4) There were decreases in the size and VGAT content of GABAergic boutons in axons of biocytin-filled FS cells in the UC, together with a decrease in colocalization with postsynaptic gephyrin, suggesting a reduction in GABAergic synapses. Quantitative EM of layer V Pyr somata confirmed the reduction in inhibitory synapses. 5) There were marked and lasting reductions in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-IR and -mRNA in Pyr cells and decreased TrkB-IR on PV cells in UC cortex. 6) Results lead to the hypothesis that reduction in trophic support by BDNF derived from Pyr cells may contribute to the regressive changes in axonal terminals and dendrites of FS cells in the UC cortex and decreased GABAergic inhibition. Significance Injury to cortical structures is a major cause of epilepsy, accounting for about 20{\%} of cases in the general population, with an incidence as high as {\~{}} 50{\%} among brain-injured personnel in wartime. Loss of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons is a significant pathophysiological factor associated with epileptogenesis following brain trauma and other etiologies. Results of these experiments show that the largest population of cortical interneurons, the parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, are preserved in the partial neocortical isolation model of partial epilepsy. However, axonal terminals of these cells are structurally abnormal, have decreased content of GABA synthetic enzymes and vesicular GABA transporter and make fewer synapses onto pyramidal neurons. These structural abnormalities underlie defects in GABAergic neurotransmission that are a key pathophysiological factor in epileptogenesis found in electrophysiological experiments. BDNF, and its TrkB receptor, key factors for maintenance of interneurons and pyramidal neurons, are decreased in the injured cortex. Results suggest that supplying BDNF to the injured epileptogenic brain may reverse the structural and functional abnormalities in the parvalbumin FS interneurons and provide an antiepileptogenic therapy.},

abstract = {Alteration in the excitatory/inhibitory neuronal balance is believed to be the underlying mechanism of epileptogenesis. Based on this theory, GABAergic interneurons are regarded as the primary inhibitory neurons, whose failure of action permits hyperactivity in the epileptic circuitry. As a consequence, optogenetic excitation of GABAergic interneurons is widely used for seizure suppression. However, recent evidence argues for the context-dependent, possibly "excitatory" roles that GABAergic cells play in epileptic circuitry. We reviewed current optogenetic approaches that target the "inhibitory" roles of GABAergic interneurons for seizure control. We also reviewed interesting evidence that supports the "excitatory" roles of GABAergic interneurons in epileptogenesis. GABAergic interneurons can provide excitatory effects to the epileptic circuits via several distinct neurological mechanisms. (1) GABAergic interneurons can excite postsynaptic neurons, due to the raised reversal potential of GABA receptors in the postsynaptic cells. (2) Continuous activity in GABAergic interneurons could lead to transient GABA depletion, which prevents their inhibitory effect on pyramidal cells. (3) GABAergic interneurons can synchronize network activity during seizure. (4) Some GABAergic interneurons inhibit other interneurons, causing disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and network hyperexcitability. The dynamic, context-dependent role that GABAergic interneurons play in seizure requires further investigation of their functions at single cell and circuitry level. New optogenetic protocols that target GABAergic inhibition should be explored for seizure suppression.},

abstract = {THE dendrites of neurons in the mammalian central nervous system have been considered as electrically passive structures which funnel synaptic potentials to the soma and axon initial segment, the site of action potential initiation1,2. More recent studies, however, have shown that the dendrites of many neurons are not passive, but contain active conductances 3,4. The role of these dendritic voltage-activated channels in the initiation of action potentials in neurons is largely unknown. To assess this directly, patch-clamp recordings were made from the dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in brain slices. Voltage-activated sodium currents were observed in dendritic outside-out patches, while action potentials could be evoked by depolarizing current pulses or by synaptic stimulation during dendritic whole-cell recordings. To determine the site of initiation of these action potentials, simultaneous whole-cell recordings were made from the soma and the apical dendrite or axon of the same cell. These experiments showed that action potentials are initiated first in the axon and then actively propagate back into the dendritic tree. {\textcopyright} 1994 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed that the epileptic cortex is fragile in the sense that seizures manifest through small perturbations in the synaptic connections that render the entire cortical network unstable. Therefore, one method for detecting seizures is to detect when the neuronal network has gone unstable. This is important for implementing a closed-loop therapy to suppress seizures. In this paper, we consider a widely used nonlinear stochastic model of a neuronal network, and assume that spiking dynamics during non-seizure periods correspond to certain synaptic connections that render its fixed point stable. We then apply a minimum energy perturbation theory we recently developed for networks to determine the changes in the most fragile node's synaptic connections that make the same fixed point unstable (our model during seizure). Then a detector is designed as follows. First a 2-state HMM is constructed (stable=state 1 and unstable=state 2) with fixed state transition probabilities, where the output observation is the firing rate of the most fragile node in the network. The output density functions are assumed to be Gaussian with parameters computed using maximum likelihood estimation on data generated from the nonlinear network model in each state. Then, to detect a transition from stable to unstable, spiking activity is simulated in all nodes from the nonlinear model. The detector first measures the firing rate of the fragile node, and computes the derivative of the cumulative likelihood ratio of the observed firing rate from the HMM's output distributions. When the derivative exceeds a certain threshold, a transition to the unstable state is detected. Various thresholds were tested when firing rate was computed by averaging over a different number of windows of different lengths. High performance was achieved and a tradeoff was found between the accuracy of the detector and the detection delay.},

These cells showed abrupt episodes of nonadapting repetitive discharges; (ii) late-spiking (LS) cells exhibiting slowly developing ramp depolarizations, including neurogliaform cells; (iii) the remaining groups contained both burst-spiking (BS) or regular-spiking (RS) non-pyramidal (NP)cells. BSNP cells exhibited bursting activity (two or more spikes on slow depolarizing humps) from hyperpo1arized potentials. Both these physiological types corresponded to a range of morphologies: (i) somatostatin containing Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors to layer I (some were also positive for calbindin D28(k)); (ii) VIP- containing double bouquet cells with descending axonal arbors as well as arcade cells (these included small cells immunoreactive for CCK or calretinin).

abstract = {Schizophrenia has often been conceived as a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. We tested this hypothesis by measuring aspects of both functional connectivity and functional network topology derived from resting-state fMRI time series acquired at 72 cerebral regions over 17 min from 15 healthy volunteers (14 male, 1 female) and 12 people diagnosed with schizophrenia (10 male, 2 female). We investigated between-group differences in strength and diversity of functional connectivity in the 0.06-0.125 Hz frequency interval, and some topological properties of undirected graphs constructed from thresholded interregional correlation matrices. In people with schizophrenia, strength of functional connectivity was significantly decreased, whereas diversity of functional connections was increased. Topologically, functional brain networks had reduced clustering and small-worldness, reduced probability of high-degree hubs, and increased robustness in the schizophrenic group. Reduced degree and clustering were locally significant in medial parietal, premotor and cingulate, and right orbitofrontal cortical nodes of functional networks in schizophrenia. Functional connectivity and topological metrics were correlated with each other and with behavioral performance on a verbal fluency task. We conclude that people with schizophrenia tend to have a less strongly integrated, more diverse profile of brain functional connectivity, associated with a less hub-dominated configuration of complex brain functional networks. Alongside these behaviorally disadvantageous differences, however, brain networks in the schizophrenic group also showed a greater robustness to random attack, pointing to a possible benefit of the schizophrenia connectome, if less extremely expressed.},

abstract = {How does the human brain's structural scaffold give rise to its intricate functional dynamics? This is a central challenge in translational neuroscience, particularly in epilepsy, a disorder that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Treatment for medication-resistant focal epilepsy is often structural - through surgery, devices or focal laser ablation - but structural targets, particularly in patients without clear lesions, are largely based on functional mapping via intracranial EEG (iEEG). Unfortunately, the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the seizing brain is poorly understood. In this study, we quantify structure-function coupling, specifically between white matter connections and iEEG, across preictal and ictal periods in 45 seizures from 9 patients with unilateral drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We use High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) tractography to construct structural connectivity networks and correlate these networks with time-varying broadband and frequency-specific functional networks derived from coregistered iEEG. Across all frequency bands, we find significant increases in structure-function coupling from preictal to ictal periods. We demonstrate that short-range structural connections are primarily responsible for this increase in coupling. Finally, we find that spatiotemporal patterns of structure-function coupling are stereotyped, and a function of each patient's individual anatomy. These results suggest that seizures harness the underlying structural connectome as they propagate. Our findings suggest that the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in epilepsy may inform current and new therapies to map and alter seizure spread, and pave the way for better-targeted, patient-specific interventions.},

abstract = {Most fMRI studies of the brain's intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) have assumed that this is static; however, it is now clear that it changes over time. This is particularly relevant in epilepsy, which is characterized by a continuous interchange between epileptic and normal brain states associated with the occurrence of epileptic activity. Interestingly, recurrent states of dynamic FC (dFC) have been found in fMRI data using unsupervised learning techniques, assuming either their sparse or non-sparse combination. Here, we propose an l1-norm regularized dictionary learning (l1-DL) approach for dFC state estimation, which allows an intermediate and flexible degree of sparsity in time, and demonstrate its application in the identification of epilepsy-related dFC states using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. With this l1-DL approach, we aim to accommodate a potentially varying degree of sparsity upon the interchange between epileptic and non-epileptic dFC states. The simultaneous recording of the EEG is used to extract time courses representative of epileptic activity, which are incorporated into the fMRI dFC state analysis to inform the selection of epilepsy-related dFC states. We found that the proposed l1-DL method performed best at identifying epilepsy-related dFC states, when compared with two alternative methods of extreme sparsity (k-means clustering, maximum; and principal component analysis, minimum), as well as an l0-norm regularization framework (l0-DL), with a fixed amount of temporal sparsity. We further showed that epilepsy-related dFC states provide novel insights into the dynamics of epileptic networks, which go beyond the information provided by more conventional EEG-correlated fMRI analysis, and which were concordant with the clinical profile of each patient. In addition to its application in epilepsy, our study provides a new dFC state identification method of potential relevance for studying brain functional connectivity dynamics in general.},

abstract = {See Eissa and Schevon (doi:10.1093/aww332) for a scientific commentary on this article. Surgery can be a last resort for patients with intractable, medically refractory epilepsy. For many of these patients, however, there is substantial risk that the surgery will be ineffective. The prediction of who is likely to benefit from a surgical approach is crucial for being able to inform patients better, conduct principled prospective clinical trials, and ultimately tailor therapeutic approaches to these patients more effectively. Dynamical computational models, informed with patient data, can be used to make predictions and give mechanistic insight. In this study, we develop patient-specific dynamical network models of epileptogenic cortex. We infer the network connectivity matrix from non-seizure electrographic recordings of patients and use these connectivity matrices as the network structure in our model. The model simulates the dynamics of a bi-stable switch at every node in this network, meaning that every node starts in a background state, but has the ability to transit to a co-existing seizure state. Whether a transition happens in a node is partly determined by the stochastic nature of the input to the node, but also by the input the node receives from other connected nodes in the network. By conducting simulations with such a model, we can detect the average transition time for nodes in a given network, and therefore define nodes with a short transition time as highly epileptogenic. In a retrospective study, we found that in some patients the regions with high epileptogenicity in the model overlap with those identified clinically as the seizure onset zone. Moreover, it was found that the resection of these regions in the model reduces the overall likelihood of a seizure. Following removal of these regions in the model, we predicted surgical outcomes and compared these to actual patient outcomes. Our predictions were found to be 81.3{\%} accurate on a dataset of 16 patients with intractable epilepsy. Intriguingly, in patients with unsuccessful outcomes, the proposed computational approach is able to suggest alternative resection sites. The model presented here gives mechanistic insight as to why surgery may be unsuccessful in some patients. This may aid clinicians in presurgical evaluation by providing a tool to explore various surgical options, offering complementary information to existing clinical techniques.},

abstract = {High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are estimated as a potential marker for epileptogenicity. Current research strives for valid evidence that these HFOs could aid the delineation of the to-be resected area in patients with refractory epilepsy and improve surgical outcomes. In the present meta-analysis, we evaluated the relation between resection of regions from which HFOs can be detected and outcome after epilepsy surgery. We conducted a systematic review of all studies that related the resection of HFO-generating areas to postsurgical outcome. We related the outcome (seizure freedom) to resection ratio, that is, the ratio between the number of channels on which HFOs were detected and, among these, the number of channels that were inside the resected area. We compared the resection ratio between seizure free and not seizure free patients. In total, 11 studies were included. In 10 studies, ripples (80-200 Hz) were analyzed, and in 7 studies, fast ripples ({\textgreater}200 Hz) were studied. We found comparable differences (dif) and largely overlapping confidence intervals (CI) in resection ratios between outcome groups for ripples (dif=0.18; CI: 0.10-0.27) and fast ripples (dif=0.17; CI: 0.01-0.33). Subgroup analysis showed that automated detection (dif=0.22; CI: 0.03-0.41) was comparable to visual detection (dif=0.17; CI: 0.08-0.27). Considering frequency of HFOs (dif=0.24; CI: 0.09-0.38) was related more strongly to outcome than considering each electrode that was showing HFOs (dif=0.15; CI=0.03-0.27). The effect sizes found in the meta-analysis are small but significant. Automated detection and application of a detection threshold in order to detect channels with a frequent occurrence of HFOs is important to yield a marker that could be useful in presurgical evaluation. In order to compare studies with different methodological approaches, detailed and standardized reporting is warranted.},

abstract = {Even though recent studies have suggested that seizures do not occur suddenly and that before a seizure there is a period with an increased probability of seizure occurrence, neurophysiological mechanisms of interictal and pre-seizure states are unknown. The ability of mathematical methods to provide much more sensitive tools for the detection of subtle changes in the electrical activity of the brain gives promise that electrophysiological markers of enhanced seizure susceptibility can be found even during interictal periods when EEG of epilepsy patients often looks 'normal'. Previously, we demonstrated in animals that hippocampal and neocortical gamma-band rhythms (30–100 Hz) intensify long before seizures caused by systemic infusion of kainic acid. Other studies in recent years have also drawn attention to the fast activity ({\textgreater}30 Hz) as a possible marker of epileptogenic tissue. The current study quantified gamma-band activity during interictal periods and seizures in intracranial EEG (iEEG) in 5 patients implanted with subdural grids/intracranial electrodes during their pre-surgical evaluation. In all our patients, we found distinctive (abnormal) bursts of gamma activity with a 3 to 100 fold increase in power at gamma frequencies with respect to selected by clinicians, quiescent, artifact-free, 7–20 min "normal" background (interictal) iEEG epochs 1 to 14 hours prior to seizures. Increases in gamma activity were largest in those channels which later displayed the most intensive electrographic seizure discharges. Moreover, location of gamma-band bursts correlated (with high specificity, 96.4{\%} and sensitivity, 83.8{\%}) with seizure onset zone (SOZ) determined by clinicians. Spatial localization of interictal gamma rhythms within SOZ suggests that the persistent presence of abnormally intensified gamma rhythms in the EEG may be an important tool for focus localization and possibly a determinant of epileptogenesis.},

@article{Modur2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics of intracranial ictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). METHODS: Among neocortical epilepsy patients who underwent intracranial monitoring and surgery, we studied patients with well-defined, unifocal seizure onsets characterized by discrete HFOs ({\textgreater}/=70 Hz). Patients with multifocal or bilateral independent seizure onsets, electroencephalography (EEG) acquired at {\textless}1,000 Hz sampling rate, and nonresective surgery were excluded. Based on a prospectively defined protocol, we defined the seizure-onset zone (SOZ) presurgically to include only those channels with HFOs that showed subsequent sustained evolution (HFOs+ channels) but not the channels that lacked evolution (HFOs- channels). We then resected the SOZ as defined above, 1 cm of the surrounding cortex, and immediate spread area, modified by the presence of eloquent cortex in the vicinity. For purposes of this study, we also defined the SOZ based on the conventional frequency activity (CFA, {\textless}70 Hz) at seizure onset, although that information was not considered for preoperative determination of the surgical boundary. We investigated the temporal and spatial characteristics of the ictal HFOs post hoc by visual and spectral methods, and also compared them to the seizure onset defined by the CFA. KEY FINDINGS: Of 14 consecutive neocortical epilepsy patients, six patients met the inclusion criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal or showed heterotopia. All had subdural electrodes, with additional intracerebral depth electrodes in some. Electrode coverage was extensive (median 94 channels), including limited contralateral coverage. Seizure onsets were lobar or multilobar. Resections were performed per protocol, except in two patients where complete resection of the SOZ could not be done due to overlap with speech area. Histology was abnormal in all patients. Postoperative outcome was class I/II (n = 5, 83{\%}) or class III over a mean follow-up of 27 months. Post hoc analysis of 15 representative seizures showed that the ictal HFOs were widespread at seizure onset but evolved subsequently with different characteristics. In contrast to HFOs-, the HFOs+ were significantly higher in peak frequency (97.1 vs. 89.1 Hz, p = 0.001), more robust (nearly twofold higher peak power, p {\textless} 0.0001), and spatially restricted [mean 12.2 vs. 22.4 channels; odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.62; p {\textless} 0.0001]. The seizure onset defined by HFOs+ was earlier (by an average of 0.41 s), and occurred in a significantly different and smaller distribution (OR 0.27, 95{\%} CI 0.21-0.34, p {\textless} 0.0001), than the seizure onset defined by the CFA. As intended, the HFOs+ channels were 10 times more likely to have been resected than the HFOs- channels (OR 9.7, 95{\%} CI 5-17, p {\textless} 0.0001). SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates the widespread occurrence of ictal HFOs at seizure onset, outlines a practical method to localize the SOZ based on their restricted pattern of evolution, and highlights the differences between the SOZs defined by HFOs and CFA. We show that smaller resections, restricted mainly to the HFOs channels with evolution, can lead to favorable seizure outcome. Our findings support the notion of widespread epileptic networks underlying neocortical epilepsy.},

abstract = {Indentifying lateralization of bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging issue, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and routine band electrocorticography (ECoG) fail to reveal the epileptogenic focus for further temporal lobectomy treatment. HFOs can be utilized as a biomarker for lateralizing the onset zone in suspected bitemporal epilepsy. Except subjective vision detect the HFOs, objective verification should be performed to raising the accuracy. In present research, we prospectively studied 10 patients with refractory temporal seizures and underwent electrocorticography (ECoG) with wide-band frequency amplifiers (2048Hz), all patients had a Class I outcome after temporal resection. Pre- and ictal HFOs will be analyzed by wavelet transform (WT) and Granger causality (GC) for objectively verifying lateralization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). WT analysis showed ictal HFOs in 10 patients mainly covered from 80Hz to 115 Hz (average, 92.59 ± 10.23Hz ), and there was distinct band-pass boundary between pre-ictal HFOs and ictal HFOs. GC analysis showed 5 patients (2, 4, 5, 6, 7), no matter pre-ictal or ictal state, had highest GC degree in SOZ itself. The remaining patients (1, 3, 8, 9, 10) had highest GC degree in SOZ with its adjacent regions in pre-ictal and ictal stage. GC analysis further confirmed the result of WT, and suggested HFOs is initiated and propagated in local brain region mainly, afterwards, transmitting to adjacent brain regions. These results indicated that combination of WT and GC analysis significantly contribute to accurate lateralizing patients with suspected bitemporal epilepsy.},

abstract = {Studies to improve the efficacy of epilepsy surgery have focused on better refining the localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) with the aim of effectively resecting it. However, in a considerable number of patients, EZs are distributed across multiple brain regions and may involve eloquent areas that cannot be removed due to the risk of neurological complications. There is a clear need for developing alternative approaches to induce seizure relief, but minimal impact on normal brain functions. Here, we develop a personalized in-silico network approach, that suggests effective and safe surgical interventions for each patient. Based on the clinically identified EZ, we employ modularity analysis to identify target brain regions and fiber tracts involved in seizure propagation. We then construct and simulate a patient-specific brain network model comprising phenomenological neural mass models at the nodes, and patient-specific structural brain connectivity using the neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain (TVB), in order to evaluate effectiveness and safety of the target zones (TZs). In particular, we assess safety via electrical stimulation for pre- and post-surgical condition to quantify the impact on the signal transmission properties of the network. We demonstrate the existence of a large repertoire of efficient surgical interventions resulting in reduction of degree of seizure spread, but only a small subset of them proves safe. The identification of novel surgical interventions through modularity analysis and brain network simulations may provide exciting solutions to the treatment of inoperable epilepsies.},

Raw traces from intracerebral and subdural recordings were assessed visually in conjunction with changes in the following spectral variables (calculated for consecutive 1.28 sec epochs): amplitude (sum of amplitude of all components within a frequency band), activity, mobility, and complexity. The time course of these variables during preictal and ictal periods was displayed and assessed. This technique proved effective for detecting low-amplitude high-frequency activity and subtle electrodecremental events. It was concluded that: (a) most patients ( 12 15) showed early electrodecremental events, generalised or local, mainly involving frequencies below 40 Hz; (b) generalised electrodecremental events at onset did not imply poor outcome; (c) localised high-frequency activity, between 20 and 80 Hz, was associated with a good outcome. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The electroencephalogram of a patient with intractable epilepsy was recorded with chronically implanted depth electrodes. The activity during a seizure was analyzed by an autoregressive spectral analysis technique that permits the calculation of the power spectra for all channels and the coherence between all possible channel pairings. The partial or residual coherence between a channel pair was calculated after a regression analysis had removed the influence of a third channel. If the coherence between two channels, in a frequency range of high spectral energy, fell to zero after partialing on a third channel, the latter was considered to drive the other two channels. A single site was sought which appeared to drive all other areas by analyzing all possible channel pairings and triplings. The source and spread of the seizure was determined by analyzing sequential data epochs. The analysis revealed the ictal activity arose in a single region, then spread over several pathways. The power spectra of the ictal activity revaled peaks in several frequency regions. Calculation of coherences and partial coherences in each of these frequency regions revealed different driving channels and, with analysis of sequential epochs, different pathways of spread of the ictal activity occurring at these frequencies. The spectral analysis technique provides, therefore, details of the seizure propagation and pacemaker activity not possible with conventional visual analysis of the analog data. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {E pilepsy is the second most commonly reported neurologic condition worldwide and affects people of both sexes and of all ages and socioeconomic statuses. 1 It is a frequent reason for consultation in primary care, and 80{\%} of epilepsy costs are attributed to patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. 2 Patients for whom medical treatment fails may be candidates for surgical intervention. The modern era of epilepsy surgery began in England in the late 1800s, with a focus on neocor-tical resection. 3 In the 1940s, Jasper and Penfield began performing mesial temporal lobe resections at the Montreal Neurological Institute; this is now the most commonly performed surgery for treatment of epilepsy. 3 However, epilepsy surgery remains underutilized. For example, a recent report from the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee estimated that 2{\%} of Ontario patients eligible for such surgery actually received it. 4 We review the indications for and the benefits and risks of surgical interventions for epilepsy based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case series (Box 1). The natural history of epilepsy in those taking antiepileptic drugs has been explored in several long-term, population-based cohort studies. 5-8 The probability of achieving one-year freedom from seizures after trying two to three drugs is between 63{\%} and 79{\%} (95{\%} CI 53{\%}-81{\%}). 5-7 However, as many as 68{\%} (95{\%} CI 65{\%}-70{\%}) of patients with focal epilepsy are resistant to drug therapy, 9 which means that adequate trials of medical therapy with two "tolerated, appropriately chosen and used antiepileptic drug schedules have failed to achieve sustained seizure freedom" 10 ("adequate" implies appropriate drug treatment of sufficient strength whether as monotherapy or in combination). Failure of two or more antiepileptic drugs to sustain freedom from seizures is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients are unlikely to respond to additional drug treatment. 5,10,11 Only 3{\%}-5{\%} of such patients per year eventually achieve seizure remission periods of one year with further antiepileptic drug therapy, and seizures recur in 71{\%}-80{\%} of these patients. 11,12 A recent review of the impact of epilepsy showed that uncontrolled epilepsy is not only costly but is also associated with adverse cognitive effects, poor quality of life and increased mortality. 13 Which surgical procedures are available to treat epilepsy? Whether seizures are focal or generalized determines the type of surgical procedure. Complete resection of the epileptogenic focus leads to the best results-that is, freedom from seizures. 14,15 For patients in whom resection of the epilepto-genic zone is impossible because it overlaps with eloquent cortex that would result in neurologic deficits, nonresective procedures may be indicated. These less commonly performed procedures include corpus callosotomy and vagus nerve stimulation. These are generally less effective than complete removal of the epileptogenic zone. Surgical interventions for patients with epilepsy can be grouped into three main categories. Surgical resection or disconnection For patients who experience seizures with focal or regional onset, surgical resection is the optimal procedure. This is the most common surgical inter-Review CMAJ • Patients who continue to have seizures despite appropriate trials of two antiepileptic drugs are unlikely to ever achieve sustained freedom from seizures with medical therapy. • Surgical resection of the epileptogenic focus in carefully selected patients is highly effective, has durable effects and is cost-effective. • Major complications of epilepsy surgery are infrequent and usually temporary but may rarely include dysphasia, memory decline and hemiparesis. • Epilepsy surgery should be considered for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and disabling seizures. • Although best results are seen for focal epilepsy, surgery can also be considered for patients without a clear lesion on neuroimaging and those with generalized epilepsy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To provide 1995 estimates of the lifetime and annual cost of epilepsy in the United States using data from patients with epilepsy, and adjusting for the effects of comorbidities and socioeconomic conditions. METHODS Direct treatment-related costs of epilepsy from onset through 6 years were derived from billing and medical chart data for 608 population-based incident cases at two sites in different regions of the country. Indirect productivity-related costs were derived from a survey of 1,168 adult patients visiting regional treatment centers. Direct costs separate the effects of epilepsy and comorbidity conditions. Indirect costs account for the effects of other disabilities and socioeconomic conditions on foregone earnings and household activity. The estimates were applied to 1995 population figures to derive national projections of the lifetime and annual costs of the disorder. RESULTS The lifetime cost of epilepsy for an estimated 181,000 people with onset in 1995 is projected at {\$}11.1 billion, and the annual cost for the estimated 2.3 million prevalent cases is estimated at {\$}12.5 billion. Indirect costs account for 85{\%} of the total and, with direct costs, are concentrated in people with intractable epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS Direct costs attributable to epilepsy are below previous estimates. Indirect costs adjusted for the socioeconomic conditions of patients are above previous estimates. Findings indicate that epilepsy is unique in the large proportion of costs that are productivity-related, justifying further investment in the development of effective interventions.},

abstract = {Resective surgery is the most effective way to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. Despite extensive pre-surgical evaluation, only 30–70{\%} patients would become seizure-free after surgery. New approaches and strategies are needed to improve the outcome of epilepsy surgery. It is commonly observed in clinical practice that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) could maintain seizure freedom in a large proportion of patients after surgery, who were uncontrolled before the operation. In some patients cessation of AEDs leads to seizure recurrence which, in most cases, can be controlled by resuming AEDs. These observations suggest that the surgery has converted the epilepsy from drug-resistant to drug-responsive, implying that the operation has removed the brain tissue accounting for pharmacoresistance, rather than the pathological substrate of epilepsy (at least not completely). Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that there is a drug-resistant epileptogenic zone (DREZ) which overlaps with the epileptogenic zone (EZ), and has both epileptogenic and drug-resistant properties. DREZ is necessary and sufficient to cause drug-resistant epilepsy, and its remove would render the epilepsy drug-responsive. Testing the hypothesis requires the development of new methods to define the DREZ, which may be used to guide surgical planning when the epileptogenic zone cannot be completely excised. This concept can also help understand the mechanisms of drug-resistant epilepsy, leading to new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} American Epilepsy Society. A "concept" refers to what exists in the mind as a representation (as in something comprehended) or as a formulation (as in a plan). It is generally understood as "any idea of what a thing ought to be" (Merriam-Webster). From that premise, an "idea" cannot be compartmentalized or rigidly defined as exclusively belonging to any single individual or school of thought. The utility of a concept is inherently linked to its adaptability to the needs and conditions of the time. I state this upfront because over the past several decades, the concept of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) has become so crucial to the foundation of major schools of surgical epilepsy that discussions and opinions on the topic have essentially sought to legitimize one view while criticizing the other. This review is not a referendum on any specific definition of the EZ but rather a chronological analysis of the historical evolution of this concept and the invasive EEG tools used to study it. The goal is to highlight common ground necessary to tackle the ever-present challenge of defining the ideal resection for a patient with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.},

abstract = {Objective: Although epilepsy surgery is an effective treatment option, at least 20{\%}-40{\%} of patients can continue to experience uncontrolled seizures resulting from incomplete resection of the lesion, epileptogenic zone, or secondary epileptogenesis. Reoperation could eliminate or improve seizures. Authors of this study evaluated outcomes following reoperation in a pediatric population. Methods: A retrospective single-center analysis of all patients who had undergone resective epilepsy surgery in the period from 2001 to 2013 was performed. After excluding children who had repeat hemispherotomy, there were 24 children who had undergone a second surgery and 2 children who had undergone a third surgery. All patients underwent MRI and video electroencephalography (VEEG) and 21 underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) prior to reoperation. Results: The mean age at the first and second surgery was 7.66 (SD 4.11) and 10.67 (SD 4.02) years, respectively. The time between operations ranged from 0.03 to 9 years. At reoperation, 8 patients underwent extended cortical resection; 8, lobectomy; 5, lesionectomy; and 3, functional hemispherotomy. One year after reoperation, 58{\%} of the children were completely seizure free (International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE] Class 1) and 75{\%} had a reduction in seizures (ILAE Classes 1-4). Patients with MEG clustered dipoles were more likely to be seizure free than to have persistent seizures (71{\%} vs 40{\%}, p = 0.08). Conclusions: Reoperation in children with recurrent seizures after the first epilepsy surgery could result in favorable seizure outcomes. Those with residual lesion after the first surgery should undergo complete resection of the lesion to improve seizure outcome. In addition to MRI and VEEG, MEG should be considered as part of the reevaluation prior to reoperation.},

Unfortunately some patients continue with seizures after epilepsy surgery and the studies have shown that approximately the 3{\%} to 15{\%} of patients with a previous failed surgical procedure are reoperated. Selected patients may be candidates for further surgery, potentially leading to a significant decrease in the frequency and severity of seizures. In patients with intractable partial epilepsy there are many possible factors, alone or in combination, that could be related to the failure of resection. Some of the factors could be genetic or acquired predisposition to epileptogenicity. In this article we report a case with intractable epilepsy that required three interventions to render seizure free.

abstract = {Surgical management of medically intractable epilepsy was historically based on the premise of excising the presumed substrate of disease, that is, "the epileptogenic zone." There was early interest in establishing the extent of resection of the temporal lobe that optimized postoperative reduction in seizure burden while preserving neurocognitive function. Studies approaching this question used varied methods of defining and measuring "extent," complicating the task of distilling evidence-based recommendations for surgical practice. A palpable shift in the paradigm of surgical epilepsy has gained traction and greatly altered not only the kind of studies being undertaken but the focus of inquiry itself. Key to this paradigm shift has been the increasingly well-held notion that epilepsy, far from being a disease of a single problem focus, is rather a disease of a problem network. Where a former generation of investigators labored to find an optimal extent of resection, concentrating on magnetic resonance imaging-visible lesions and on standardization of the extent of resection (ie, "standard temporal lobectomy"), the modern strategy is more concerned with understanding network activation and its concordance with presurgical clinical and electrophysiological features and the organization of epileptic activity over time. The vital lessons of the early literature investigating optimal extent of resection, however, remain informative to the field, and it is worthwhile to contextualize them within the modern network-focused paradigm. In this comprehensive review of the literature , we aim to recapitulate the major findings of the "optimal extent of resection" literature (focusing on both seizure control and neuropsychological outcomes) and distill wherever possible the consensus findings that may guide surgical approach to epileptic disease of the temporal lobe. We also review the particular implications of modern laser ablation techniques on the question of "optimal extent of resection" in temporal lobe epilepsy, and contextualize them as a marker of a shifting paradigm.},

The limitations of NHST have been extensively discussed, with a broad consensus that current statistical practice in the biological sciences needs reform. However, there is less agreement on reform's specific nature, with vigorous debate surrounding what would constitute a suitable alternative (Altman et al., 2000; Benjamin et al., 2017; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). An emerging view is that a more complete analytic technique would use statistical graphics to estimate effect sizes and evaluate their uncertainty (Cohen, 1994; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). As these estimation methods require only minimal statistical retraining, they have great potential to shift the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous thinking towards quantitative reasoning (Claridge-Chang and Assam, 2016). The evolution of statistics has been inextricably linked to the development of quantitative displays that support complex visual reasoning (Tufte, 2001). We consider that the graphic we describe here as estimation plot is the most intuitive way to display the complete statistical information about experimental data sets. However, a major obstacle to adopting estimation plots is accessibility to suitable software. To lower this hurdle, we have developed free software that makes high-quality estimation plotting available to all. Here, we explain the rationale for estimation plots by contrasting them with conventional charts used to display data with NHST results, and describe how the use of these graphs affords five major analytical advantages.},

The stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) method has expanded very significantly over the last 5 years, in parallel with the increase in the number of complex cases (i.e., MRI-negative) being referred with medically intractable focal epilepsy to major epilepsy surgery centers. Some centers with extensive experience in subdural electrodes are indeed changing or have changed to SEEG as the principal exploration technique, which suggests that SEEG might offer specific benefits through its approach to accurately localizing the epileptogenic zone. However, interpretation of SEEG, which is a key step to its usefulness, may vary from one center to another. This may be due to different conceptual bases and the available expertise in each center. This heterogeneity in use of SEEG should be taken into account as it could contribute to erroneous conclusions and thus unfavorable outcome of epilepsy surgery. At present, there is a lack of guidelines for optimal SEEG use, although development of these is in progress. It remains challenging to translate SEEG interpretation into a practical approach to delineating surgical strategy. Identification of clear biomarkers will help in the definition of the epileptogenic zone and subsequent cortical resection. In addition, SEEG seems to be a unique tool for the in vivo investigation of human cerebral networks distributed over several lobes or sublobar structures, allowing a better understanding of their functioning.},

Despite significant progress, roughly half of all patients undergoing focal surgical resection, and most patients receiving focal electrical stimulation, are not seizure free.

Recent findings Performing the PubMed search 'High-Frequency Oscillations and Epilepsy' for 2013-2015 identifies 308 articles exploring HFO characteristics, physiological significance, and potential clinical applications. Summary There is strong evidence that HFOs are spatially associated with epileptic brain. There remain, however, significant challenges for clinical translation of HFOs as epileptogenic brain biomarkers: Differentiating true HFO from the high-frequency power changes associated with increased neuronal firing and bandpass filtering sharp transients. Distinguishing pathological HFO from normal physiological HFO. Classifying tissue under individual electrodes as normal or pathological.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. Objective. An ability to map seizure-generating brain tissue, i.e. the seizure onset zone (SOZ), without recording actual seizures could reduce the duration of invasive EEG monitoring for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A widely-adopted practice in the literature is to compare the incidence (events/time) of putative pathological electrophysiological biomarkers associated with epileptic brain tissue with the SOZ determined from spontaneous seizures recorded with intracranial EEG, primarily using a single biomarker. Clinical translation of the previous efforts suffers from their inability to generalize across multiple patients because of (a) the inter-patient variability and (b) the temporal variability in the epileptogenic activity. Approach. Here, we report an artificial intelligence-based approach for combining multiple interictal electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics as a way of accounting for the above barriers and show that it can reliably identify seizure onset zones in a study cohort of 82 patients who underwent evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy. Main results. Our investigation provides evidence that utilizing the complementary information provided by multiple electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics can significantly improve the localization potential compared to previously published single-biomarker incidence-based approaches, resulting in an average area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.73 in a cohort of 82 patients. Our results also suggest that recording durations between 90 min and 2 h are sufficient to localize SOZs with accuracies that may prove clinically relevant. Significance. The successful validation of our approach on a large cohort of 82 patients warrants future investigation on the feasibility of utilizing intra-operative EEG monitoring and artificial intelligence to localize epileptogenic brain tissue. Broadly, our study demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence coupled with careful feature engineering in augmenting clinical decision making.},

abstract = {Purpose Using a novel technique based on phase locking value (PLV), we investigated the potential for features extracted from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings to serve as biomarkers to identify the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Methods We computed the PLV between the phase of the amplitude of high gamma activity (80–150 Hz) and the phase of lower frequency rhythms (4–30 Hz) from ECoG recordings obtained from 10 patients with epilepsy (21 seizures). We extracted five features from the PLV and used a machine learning approach based on logistic regression to build a model that classifies electrodes as SOZ or non-SOZ. Results More than 96{\%} of electrodes identified as the SOZ by our algorithm were within the resected area in six seizure-free patients. In four non-seizure-free patients, more than 31{\%} of the identified SOZ electrodes by our algorithm were outside the resected area. In addition, we observed that the seizure outcome in non-seizure-free patients correlated with the number of non-resected SOZ electrodes identified by our algorithm. Conclusion This machine learning approach, based on features extracted from the PLV, effectively identified electrodes within the SOZ. The approach has the potential to assist clinicians in surgical decision-making when pre-surgical intracranial recordings are utilized.},

abstract = {Interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFO) are a promising biomarker that can help define the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and predict the surgical outcome after the epilepsy surgery. The utility of HFO in planning the surgery, though, is unclear. Reasons include the variability of the HFO across patients and brain regions and the influence of the sleep-wake cycle, which causes large fluctuations in the ratio between the HFO observed in SOZ and non-SOZ regions. To cope with these limitations, a rank-based solution is proposed to identify the SOZ by using the HFO in multichannel intracranial EEG. A time-varying index of the epileptic susceptibility of the different brain areas is derived from the HFO rate and a support vector machine is applied on this index to identify the SOZ. The solution is trained and tested on separate groups of patients to avoid the use of patient-specific information and provides optimal SOZ prediction using as little as 30 min of recordings per channel (window). Tested on 14 patients with various combinations of seizure type, epilepsy etiology, and SOZ arrangement (172.7 ± 90.1 h/channel per patient and 75.6 ± 23.5 channels/patient, mean ± S.D.), our solution identified the SOZ with 0.92 ± 0.03 accuracy and 0.91 ± 0.03 area under the ROC curve (mean ± S.D.) across patients. For each patient, the window onset time was varied over 72 continuous hours and the prediction of the SOZ remained insensitive to the onset time, thus showing potential for surgery planning.},

abstract = {Objective High frequency oscillations (HFOs) and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) have been shown to be markers of epileptogenic regions. However, there is currently no ‘gold standard' for identifying HFOs. Accordingly, we aimed to formally characterize the interrater reliability of HFO markings to validate the current practices. Methods A morphology detector was implemented to detect events (candidate HFOs, lower-threshold events, and distractors) from the intracranial EEG (iEEG) of ten patients. Six electroencephalographers visually evaluated these events for the presence of HFOs and IEDs. Interrater reliability was calculated using pairwise Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results The HFO evaluation distributions were significantly different for most pairs of reviewers (p {\textless} 0.05; 11/15 pairs). Interrater reliability was poor for HFOs alone ($\kappa$mean = 0.403; ICC = 0.401) and HFO + IEDs ($\kappa$mean = 0.568; ICC = 0.570). Conclusions The current practice of using two visual reviewers to identify HFOs is prone to bias arising from the poor agreement between reviewers, limiting the extrinsic validity of studies using these markers. Significance The poor interrater reliability underlines the need for a framework to reconcile the important findings of existing studies. The present epoched design is an ideal candidate for the implementation of such a framework.},

abstract = {The epileptic network is characterized by pathologic, seizure-generating ‘foci' embedded in a web of structural and functional connections. Clinically, seizure foci are considered optimal targets for surgery. However, poor surgical outcome suggests a complex relationship between foci and the surrounding network that drives seizure dynamics. We developed a novel technique to objectively track seizure states from dynamic functional networks constructed from intracranial recordings. Each dynamical state captures unique patterns of network connections that indicate synchronized and desynchronized hubs of neural populations. Our approach suggests that seizures are generated when synchronous relationships near foci work in tandem with rapidly changing desynchronous relationships from the surrounding epileptic network. As seizures progress, topographical and geometrical changes in network connectivity strengthen and tighten synchronous connectivity near foci—a mechanism that may aid seizure termination. Collectively, our observations implicate distributed cortical structures in seizure generation, propagation and termination, and may have practical significance in determining which circuits to modulate with implantable devices.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder affecting ???1-2{\%} of the population. Despite the available treatment options (pharmacotherapy, surgery, and vagus nerve stimulation), a large percentage of patients continue to have seizures. With the success of deep brain stimulation for treatment of movement disorders, brain stimulation has received renewed attention as a potential treatment option for epilepsy. Responsive stimulation aims to suppress epileptiform activity by delivering stimulation directly in response to electrographic activity. Animal and human data support the concept that responsive stimulation can abort epileptiform activity, and this modality may be a safe and effective treatment option for epilepsy. Responsive stimulation has the advantage of specificity. In contrast to the typically systemic administration of pharmacotherapy, with the concomitant possibility of side effects, electrical stimulation can be targeted to the specific brain regions involved in the seizure. In addition, responsive stimulation provides temporal specificity. Treatment is provided as needed, potentially reducing the likelihood of functional disruption or habituation due to continuous treatment. Here we review current animal and human research in responsive brain stimulation for epilepsy and then discuss the NeuroPace RNS System, an investigational implantable responsive neurostimulator system that is being evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded trial to assess the safety and efficacy of responsive stimulation for the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy. ?? 2008 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.},

abstract = {There is little information available relevant to long-term seizure outcome after anterior temporal lobectomy, particularly at extended postoperative periods. The aim of this study was an in-depth examination of patterns of longitudinal outcome and potential risk factors for seizure recurrence after lobectomy, utilizing a large patient sample with long follow-up. Included were 325 patients who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy between 1978 and 1998 (mean follow-up 9.6 +/- 4.2 years). Retrospective data were analysed using survival analysis and multivariate regression with Cox proportional hazard models. The probability of complete seizure freedom at 2 years post-surgery was 55.3{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 50-61]; at 5 years, 47.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 42-53); and at 10 postoperative years it was 41{\%} (95{\%} CI 36-48). Patients with discrete abnormalities preoperatively (i.e. lesions and hippocampal sclerosis) had a significantly higher probability of seizure freedom than patients without obvious abnormality. The latter group had a pattern of recurrence similar to that in patients with lesions outside the area of excision. After adjustment for preoperative pathology, only the presence of preoperative secondarily generalized seizures had a significant association with recurrence [occasional preoperative generalized seizures, hazard ratio (HR) 1.6, 95{\%} CI 1.1-2.3; frequent seizures, HR 2.0, 95{\%} CI 1.4-2.9 compared with absence of preoperative generalized seizures]. Duration of preoperative epilepsy, age of seizure onset and age at surgery did not have an effect on outcome. Patients with two seizure-free postoperative years had a 74{\%} (95{\%} CI 66-81) probability of seizure freedom by 10 postoperative years. This late seizure recurrence was not associated with any identified risk factors. Specifically, patients with hippocampal sclerosis were not at higher risk. Surprisingly, complete discontinuation of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) after two postoperative years was not associated with an increased risk of recurrence (HR 1.03, 95{\%} CI 0.5-2.1). This may be because selection of patients for AED discontinuation is biased towards those individuals perceived as 'low risk'. The results of this study indicate that the lack of an obvious abnormality or the presence of diffuse pathology, and preoperative secondarily generalized seizures are risk factors for recurrence after surgery. Late recurrence after initial seizure freedom is not a rare event; risk factors specific to this phenomenon are as yet unidentified.},

In particular, clinicians are interested in identifying brain regions that start seizures, i.e., the epileptogenic zone (EZ) from such invasive recordings. Currently, they visually inspect signals from each electrode to locate abnormal activity, and are not informed by predictive models that can characterize such recordings and potentially increase accuracy in localizing the EZ. In this paper, we test whether a simple linear time varying (LTV) model is sufficient to characterize both ECoG and SEEG activity. Specifically, we construct linear time invariant models in consecutive time windows before, during and after seizure events creating an LTV model from data collected in one ECoG and one SEEG patient. We find that these LTV models accurately reconstruct both ECoG and SEEG time series measured suggesting that these LTV models can be used for EZ localization.},

abstract = {Formation of new recurrent excitatory circuits after brain injuries has been hypothesized as a major factor contributing to epileptogenesis. Increases in total axonal length and the density of synaptic boutons are present in layer V pyramidal neurons of chronic partial isolations of rat neocortex, a model of posttraumatic epileptogenesis. To explore the functional consequences of these changes, we used laser-scanning photostimulation combined with whole-cell patch-clamp recording from neurons in layer V of somatosensory cortex to map changes in excitatory synaptic connectivity after injury. Coronal slices were submerged in artificial CSF (23 degrees C) containing 100 microM caged glutamate, APV (2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid), and high divalent cation concentration to block polysynaptic responses. Focal uncaging of glutamate, accomplished by switching a pulsed UV laser to give a 200-400 micros light stimulus, evoked single- or multiple-component composite EPSCs. In neurons of the partially isolated cortex, there were significant increases in the fraction of uncaging sites from which EPSCs could be evoked ("hot spots") and a decrease in the mean amplitude of individual elements in the composite EPSC. When plotted along the cortical depth, the changes in EPSCs took place mainly between 150 and 200 microm above and below the somata, suggesting a specific enhancement of recurrent excitatory connectivity among layer V pyramidal neurons of the undercut neocortex. These changes may shift the balance within cortical circuits toward increased synaptic excitation and contribute to epileptogenesis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Malformations due to abnormal cortical development (MCDs) are common pathologic substrates of medically intractable epilepsy. The in situ epileptogenicity of these lesions as well as its relation to histopathologic changes remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to correlate the cellular patterns of MCDs with the expression of focal cortical epileptogenicity as assessed by direct extraoperative electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings by using subdural grids. METHODS: Fifteen patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy due to pathologically confirmed MCD who underwent subdural electrode placement for extraoperative seizure localization and cortical mapping between 1997 and 2000 were included in the study. Areas of interictal spiking and ictal-onset patterns were identified and separated during surgery for further pathologic characterization (cellular and architectural). Three pathologic groups were identified: type I; architectural disorganization with/without giant neurons, type IIA; architectural disorganization with dysmorphic neurons, and type IIB; architectural disorganization, dysmorphic neurons, and balloon cells (BCs). The focal histopathologic subtypes of MCDs in cortical tissue resected were then retrospectively correlated with in situ extraoperative ECoG patterns. RESULTS: Cortical areas with histopathologic subtype IIA showed significantly higher numbers of slow repetitive spike pattern in comparison with histopathologic type I (p = 0.007) and normal pathology (p = 0.002). The ictal onset came mainly from cortical areas with histopathologic type IIA (nine of 15 patients). None of the seizures originated from neocortical areas that showed BC-containing MCD (type IIB). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that areas containing BCs are less epileptogenic than are closely located dysplastic regions. These results suggest a possible protective effect of BCs or a severe disruption in the neuronal networks in BCs containing dysplastic lesions. Further studies are needed to elucidate the nature and the potential role(s) of balloon cells in MCD-induced epileptogenicity.},

Half of all seizure recurrences occurred within the first two postoperative months. Subsequently, the rate of seizure freedom declined by 4-5{\%} every 2-3 years.

Prospective identification of pharmacoresistance is complicated by the variability of its appearance across different types of epilepsy and the variability of seizure control within a given patient over time. Failure of informative trials of two appropriate antiepileptic drugs has been recommended as a threshold that should trigger referral for evaluation at a comprehensive epilepsy center.

abstract = {More than half of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve complete seizure control without major side-effects. Patients who continue to have seizures after initial medical therapy should have an early and detailed assessment to confirm the diagnosis, to determine the underlying cause and epilepsy syndrome, and to choose an adequate treatment strategy. The risks and potential benefits of surgical procedures or experimental therapy have to be weighed against the chance of improvement and the potential side-effects of additional medical therapy. Surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common cause of focal epilepsy, can control seizures and improve quality of life in appropriately selected patients. However, around 20-30{\%} of patients do not respond to medical or surgical treatment. The management of chronic intractable epilepsy requires comprehensive care to address the adverse events of medical treatment, quality of life issues, and comorbid disorders.

Methods We prospectively studied 525 patients (age, 9 to 93 years) who were given a diagnosis, treated, and followed up at a single center between 1984 and 1997. Epilepsy was classified as idiopathic (with a presumed genetic basis), symptomatic (resulting from a structural abnormality), or cryptogenic (resulting from an unknown underlying cause).

abstract = {Epilepsy is a neurological condition with a prevalence of 1{\%}, and 14-34{\%} have medically refractory epilepsy (MRE). Seizures in focal MRE are generated by a single epileptogenic zone (or focus), thus there is potentially a curative procedure - surgical resection. This procedure depends significantly on correct identification of the focus, which is often uncertain in clinical practice. In this study, we analyzed intracranial stereotaxic EEG (sEEG) data recorded in two human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy prior to undergoing resection surgery. We view the sEEG data as samples from the brain network and hypothesize that seizure foci can be identified based on their network connectivity during seizure. Specifically, we computed a time sequence of connectivity matrices from EEG recordings that represent network structure over time. For each patient, connectivity between electrodes was measured using the coherence in a given frequency band. Matrix structure was analyzed using singular value decomposition and the leading singular vector was used to estimate each electrode's time dependent centrality (importance to the network's connectivity). Our preliminary study suggests that seizure foci may be the most weakly connected regions in the brain during the beginning of a seizure and the most strongly connected regions towards the end of a seizure. Additionally, in one of the patients analyzed, the network connectivity under anesthesia highlights seizure foci. Ultimately, network centrality computed from sEEG activity may be used to develop an automated, reliable, and computationally efficient algorithm for identifying seizure foci.},

abstract = {Epileptic seizures reflect a pathological brain state characterized by specific clinical and electrical manifestations. The proposed mechanisms are heterogeneous but united by the supposition that epileptic activity is hypersynchronous across multiple scales, yet principled and quantitative analyses of seizure dynamics across space and throughout the entire ictal period are rare. To more completely explore spatiotemporal interactions during seizures, we examined electrocorticogram data from a population of male and female human patients with epilepsy and from these data constructed dynamic network representations using statistically robust measures. We found that these networks evolved through a distinct topological progression during the seizure. Surprisingly, the overall synchronization changed only weakly, whereas the topology changed dramatically in organization. A large subnetwork dominated the network architecture at seizure onset and preceding termination but, between, fractured into smaller groups. Common network characteristics appeared consistently for a population of subjects, and, for each subject, similar networks appeared from seizure to seizure. These results suggest that, at the macroscopic spatial scale, epilepsy is not so much a manifestation of hypersynchrony but instead of network reorganization.},

METHODS: Participants with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 46) attending a tertiary referral clinic and healthy control subjects (n = 65) underwent neuropsychological assessment and reevaluation 4 years later. Analysis of test-retest patterns identified individual patients with adverse cognition outcomes. RESULTS: The prospective cognitive trajectory of patients with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy differs from age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Lack of practice effects is common, but frank adverse cognitive outcomes are observed in a subset of patients (20-25{\%}), particularly in vulnerable cognitive domains that include memory. Cognitive declines are associated with a profile of abnormalities in baseline quantitative magnetic resonance volumetrics, lower baseline intellectual capacity, as well as longer duration of epilepsy and older chronological age. INTERPRETATION: Cognitive prognosis is poor for a subset of patients characterized by chronicity of epilepsy, older age, lower intellectual ability, and more baseline abnormalities in quantitative magnetic resonance volumetrics.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epilepsy is a common, disabling neurological disorder associated with increased rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders as compared with the general population. RECENT FINDINGS: Mood disorders, especially major depression, appear to be more prevalent in persons with epilepsy than in those with the other chronic disorders and the general population. Depression may have more influence on quality of life than do cognitive and seizure factors. Although psychological, social, and vocational disabilities contribute to mood dysfunction in epilepsy, functional neuroimaging studies have consistently shown correlation of presence of cerebral abnormalities with increased severity of symptoms of depression. Most persons with epilepsy are not routinely screened for depression, and depression is subsequently treated in only a minority of patients. Although serotonin receptor density is greatest in brain regions commonly associated with epilepsy, such as the mesial temporal and prefrontal areas, no controlled trials have investigated the efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in persons with epilepsy. Optimal methods to identify and treat depression in epilepsy require substantial further research. SUMMARY: Depression is a common comorbid condition with significant negative effects on health status in persons with epilepsy, but additional understanding of the disorder is needed to improve diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract = {Epilepsy - the world's most common serious brain disorder - is defined by recurrent unprovoked seizures that result from complex interactions between distributed neural populations. We explore some macroscopic characteristics of emergent ictal networks by considering intracranial recordings from human subjects with intractable epilepsy. For each seizure, we compute a simple measure of linear coupling between all electrode pairs (more than 2400) to define networks of interdependent electrodes during preictal and ictal time intervals. We analyze these networks by applying traditional measures from network analysis and identify statistically significant global and local changes in network topology. We find at seizure onset a diffuse breakdown in global coupling, and local changes indicative of increased throughput of specific cortical and subcortical regions. We conclude that network analysis yields measures to summarize the complicated coupling topology emergent at seizure onset. Using these measures, we can identify spatially localized brain regions that may facilitate seizures and may be potential targets for focal therapies. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Neurostimulation has emerged as a new treatment modality that has the potential to improve quality of life and occasionally be curative for patients with medically refractory epilepsy who are not surgical candidates. In order to continue to advance the frontier of this field, it is imperative to have a firm grasp of the current body of knowledge. METHODS We performed a thorough review of the current literature regarding the three main modalities of vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and closed-loop stimulation (responsive neurostimulator [RNS]) for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. For each of these forms of treatment, we discuss the current understanding of the underlying mechanism of action, patient selection, outcomes to date, and associated side effects or adverse reactions. We also provide an overview of related ongoing clinical trials. RESULTS A total of 189 sources from 1938 to 2012 pertaining to neuromodulation for the treatment of epilepsy were reviewed. Sources included review articles, clinical trials, case reports, conference proceedings, animal studies, and government data bases.

Effective treatment and management of epilepsy would be greatly improved if convulsions could be caught quickly through early seizure detection. However, this is still a largely open problem due to the challenge of finding a robust statistic from the neural measurements. This paper suggests a new multivariate statistic by combining spectral techniques with matrix theory. Specifically, stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data was used to generate a series of coherence connectivity matrices which were then examined using singular value decomposition. Tracking the relative angles of the first singular vectors generated from this data provides an effective way of defining the most dominant characteristics of the SEEG during the normal, the pre-ictal, and the ictal states. This paper indicates that the first singular vector has a characteristic direction indicative of the seizure state and illustrates a data analysis method that incorporates all neural data as opposed to a small selection of channels.},

abstract = {The human brain is a dynamic networked system. Patients with partial epileptic seizures have focal regions that periodically diverge from normal brain network dynamics during seizures. We studied the evolution of brain connectivity before, during, and after seizures with graph-theoretic techniques on continuous electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings (5.4 ± 1.7 d per patient, mean ± SD) from 12 patients with temporal, occipital, or frontal lobe partial onset seizures. Each electrode was considered a node in a graph, and edges between pairs of nodes were weighted by their coherence within a frequency band. The leading eigenvector of the connectivity matrix, which captures network structure, was tracked over time and clustered to uncover a finite set of brain network states. Across patients, we found that (i) the network connectivity is structured and defines a finite set of brain states, (ii) seizures are characterized by a consistent sequence of states, (iii) a subset of nodes is isolated from the network at seizure onset and becomes more connected with the network toward seizure termination, and (iv) the isolated nodes may identify the seizure onset zone with high specificity and sensitivity. To localize a seizure, clinicians visually inspect seizures recorded from multiple intracranial electrode contacts, a time-consuming process that may not always result in definitive localization. We show that network metrics computed from all ECoG channels capture the dynamics of the seizure onset zone as it diverges from normal overall network structure. This suggests that a state space model can be used to help localize the seizure onset zone in ECoG recordings. },

abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most frequent neurological diseases. In focal medically refractory epilepsies, successful surgical treatment largely depends on the identification of epileptogenic zone. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 80 and 500. Hz, which can be recorded with EEG, may be novel markers of the epileptogenic zone. This review discusses the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. HFOs are clearly linked to the seizure onset zone, and the surgical removal of regions generating them correlates with a seizure free post-surgical outcome. Moreover, HFOs reflect the seizure-generating capability of the underlying tissue, since they are more frequent after the reduction of antiepileptic drugs. They can be successfully used in pediatric epilepsies such as epileptic spasms and help to understand the generation of this specific type of seizures. While mostly recorded on intracranial EEGs, new studies suggest that identification of HFOs on scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is possible as well. Thus not only patients with refractory epilepsies and invasive recordings but all patients might profit from the analysis of HFOs. Despite these promising results, the analysis of HFOs is not a routine clinical procedure; most results are derived from relatively small cohorts of patients and many aspects are not yet fully understood. Thus the review concludes that even if HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptic tissue, there are still uncertainties about mechanisms of generation, methods of analysis, and clinical applicability. Large multicenter prospective studies are needed prior to widespread clinical application. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine patient-oriented outcome after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for refractory epilepsy. BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important component of the assessment of outcome from epilepsy surgery, but prior controlled studies of the effect of surgery on HRQOL are inconclusive. Direct assessment of the effect of surgery on patient concerns of living with epilepsy has not been reported. METHODS: We used reliable and valid instruments to compare HRQOL and patient concerns of 125 patients who had received an ATL more than than one year previously to a clinically similar group of 71 patients who were awaiting ATL. All patients were selected for surgery based on similar criteria. We also used bivariate correlation analysis and multivariate regression modeling to determine the association of traditional outcome variables with HRQOL. RESULTS: Patients who had undergone ATL reported significantly less concern of living with epilepsy in 16 of 20 items of the EFA Concerns Index and better HRQOL in 8 of 11 scales of the Epilepsy Surgery Inventory-55. Regression analysis in the postoperative group demonstrated that mood status, employment, driving, and antiepileptic drug (AED) cessation, but not seizure-free status or IQ, were associated with better HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a positive affect of ATL on patient concerns and HRQOL in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, although longitudinal studies are needed to corroborate these results. Mood, employment, driving ability, and AED use are important postoperative predictors of HRQOL.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Intractable epilepsy is the focus of much research; however, this concept is defined in no single way. Individual studies use different definitions, creating difficulties for comparisons of results across studies. A head-to-head comparison of definitions could highlight these differences and motivate the development of consensus guidelines. METHODS: Within a single prospective study of 613 children in Connecticut with newly diagnosed epilepsy (1993-1997), six different published definitions or indicators for intractability were applied and compared. All definitions were assessed at various times within the first 5 years after diagnosis, with the exact timing reflecting how they were used in their initial reports. Observed and chance-adjusted agreement (kappa) were computed. The associations of each definition with remission status 7-10 years after diagnosis were quantified with a relative risk. RESULTS: Depending on the specific definition, the epilepsy of 9-24{\%} of children was considered intractable. Observed agreements among the definitions ranged from a low of 0.83 to a high of 0.96. Kappas ranged from low of 0.45 to 0.79. More similar definitions had higher levels of agreement. All definitions were strongly associated with remission status as of last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement among the different definitions is strong but imperfect. All definitions were significantly associated with longer-term outcome. No single preferred definition of intractable epilepsy exists. Some discussion within the field of epilepsy and a consensus process should be considered as a future step for enhancing comparability of research efforts and clinical guidelines. Consideration should be given to whether a single definition will suit all purposes or whether different types of definitions are needed for different purposes.},

abstract = {Purpose: To measure the interrater reliability of presurgical testing and surgical decisions among epilepsy centers. Methods: Seven centers participating in an ongoing, prospective multicenter study of resective epilepsy surgery agreed to conform to a detailed protocol regarding presurgical evaluation and surgery. To assess quality assurance, each center independently reviewed 21 randomly selected surgical cases for preoperative study lateralization and localization, and surgical decisions. Interrater reliability was assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), validated for use with multiple raters, and calculated in a two-way random model based on absolute agreement. Results: Agreement for ICC values: ≥0.75, excellent; 0.60-0.74, good; 0.40-0.59, fair; ≤0.39, poor. One center was excluded for missing data. Agreement was excellent for extracranial EEG lateralization (0.8039), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lateralization (0.9521) and localization (0.9130), Wada lateralization (0.9453), and intracranial EEG localization (0.7905). Agreement was good for extracranial EEG localization (0.7384) and neuropsychological testing lateralization (0,7178) and localization (0.6891). Consensus about the decision to perform intracranial monitoring was fair (0.5397), in part reflecting one center's tendency toward intracranial monitoring. Overall agreements on whether to perform surgery (0.8311) and specific surgery recommended (0.8164) were excellent. Conclusions: High interrater reliability among six epilepsy centers was present for interpretation of most components of presurgical testing. Although consensus for the decision to perform intracranial monitoring was only fair, agreements for the ultimate decision about resective surgery and specific choice of resection were excellent. We believe that this study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing multicenter protocols for neurologic management, especially those involving localization, as well as protocols combining study results with clinical decision making.},

abstract = {Epilepsy surgery has become an important treatment option in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The ability to precisely localize the epileptogenic zone is crucial for surgical success. The tools available for localization of the epileptogenic zone are limited. Seizure semiology is a simple and cost effective tool that allows localization of the symptomatogenic zone which either overlaps or is in close proximity of the epileptogenic zone. This becomes particularly important in cases of MRI negative focal epilepsy. The ability to video record seizures made it possible to discover new localizing signs and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of others. Ideally the signs used for localization should fulfill these criteria; 1) Easy to identify and have a high inter-rater reliability, 2) It has to be the first or one of the earlier components of the seizure in order to have localizing value. Later symptoms or signs are more likely to be due to ictal spread and may have only a lateralizing value. 3) The symptomatogenic zone corresponding to the recorded ictal symptom has to be clearly defined and well documented. Reproducibility of the initial ictal symptoms with cortical stimulation identifies the corresponding symptomatogenic zone. Unfortunately, however, not all ictal symptoms can be reproduced by focal cortical stimulation. Therefore, the problem the clinician faces is trying to deduce the epileptogenic zone from the seizure semiology. The semiological classification system is particularly useful in this regard. We present the known localizing and lateralizing signs based on this system.},

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80-500 Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and postresection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches. METHODS We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs; 250-500 Hz) and ripples (80-250 Hz), and spikes in pre- and postresection ECoG sampled at 2,048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of electroencephalography (EEG) event occurrence: pre+post- (+/-), pre+post+ (+/+), pre-post+ (-/+) and pre-post- (-/-). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement; lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement; and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG events, time to recurrence, and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free vs recurrence). RESULTS We included 54 patients (median age, 15.5 years; 25 months of follow-up; 30 seizure free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples, or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/-, +/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio, 3.13; confidence interval = 1.22-6.25; p = 0.01). Seven of 8 patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches. INTERPRETATION FRs that persist before and after resection predict poor postsurgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intraoperative ECoG measurements. Ann Neurol 2017;81:664-676.},

METHODS We studied, retrospectively, ECoG recorded at 2,048 Hz after resection in a cohort of patients with refractory focal epilepsy. We analyzed occurrence and number of residual FRs, ripples, interictal spikes, and ictiform spike patterns within the last minute of each recording and compared these to seizure recurrence. RESULTS We included 54 patients (median age 15.5 years) with 25 months median follow-up. Twenty-four patients had recurrent seizures. We found residual FRs, ripples, spikes, and ictiform spike patterns in 12, 51, 38, and 9 patients. Nine out of 12 patients with residual FRs had recurrent seizures (p = 0.016, positive predictive value 75{\%}). Other ECoG events did not predict seizure recurrence. Patients with seizures had higher FR rates than seizure-free patients (p = 0.022). FRs near the resection and in distant pathologic areas could have changed the resection in 8 patients without harming functionally eloquent areas. One seizure-free patient had FRs in distant functionally eloquent areas. CONCLUSIONS Residual FRs in post-resection ECoG are prognostic markers for seizure recurrence, especially if their number is high. Tailoring could rely on FRs, but requires careful assessment of the ECoG, as FRs in functionally eloquent areas might not be pathologic.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) excel on many complex perceptual tasks but it has proven notoriously difficult to understand how they reach their decisions. We here introduce a high-performance DNN architecture on ImageNet whose decisions are considerably easier to explain. Our model, a simple variant of the ResNet-50 architecture called BagNet, classifies an image based on the occurrences of small local image features without taking into account their spatial ordering. This strategy is closely related to the bag-of-feature (BoF) models popular before the onset of deep learning and reaches a surprisingly high accuracy on ImageNet (87.6{\%} top-5 for 33 × 33 px features and Alexnet performance for 17 × 17 px features). The constraint on local features makes it straightforward to analyse how exactly each part of the image influences the classification. Furthermore, the BagNets behave similar to state-of-the art deep neural networks such as VGG-16, ResNet-152 or DenseNet-169 in terms of feature sensitivity, error distribution and interactions between image parts. This suggests that the improvements of DNNs over previous bag-of-feature classifiers in the last few years is mostly achieved by better fine-tuning rather than by qualitatively different decision strategies.},

abstract = {Ensemble methods-particularly those based on decision trees-have recently demonstrated superior performance in a variety of machine learning settings. We introduce a generalization of many existing decision tree methods called "Random Projection Forests" (RPF), which is any decision forest that uses (possibly data dependent and random) linear projections. Using this framework, we introduce a special case, called "Lumberjack", using very sparse random projections, that is, linear combinations of a small subset of features. Lumberjack obtains statistically significantly improved accuracy over Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and other approaches on a standard benchmark suites for classification with varying dimension, sample size, and number of classes. To illustrate how, why, and when Lumberjack outperforms other methods, we conduct extensive simulated experiments, in vectors, images, and nonlinear mani-folds. Lumberjack typically yields improved performance over existing decision trees ensembles, while mitigating computational efficiency and scalability, and maintaining interpretability. Lumberjack can easily be incorporated into other ensemble methods such as boosting to obtain potentially similar gains.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * * , 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.},

These regions are involved during normal movements, however, associative cortices and hippocampus are also likely involved during perturbed movements as one must detect the unexpected disturbance, inhibit the previous motor plan, and create a new plan to compensate. Minimal data is available on these brain regions during such "robust" movements. Here, epileptic patients implanted with intracerebral electrodes performed reaching movements while experiencing occasional unexpected force perturbations allowing study of the fronto-parietal, limbic and hippocampal network at unprecedented high spatial, and temporal scales. Areas including orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus showed increased activation during perturbed trials. These results, coupled with a visual novelty control task, suggest the hippocampal MTL-P300 novelty response is modality independent, and that the OFC is involved in modifying motor plans during robust movement.},

Internal bias (e.g., emotion) contributes to this variability and is shaped by past outcomes, yet its neurobiology during decision-making is not well understood. To map neural circuits encoding bias, we administered a gambling task to 10 participants implanted with intracerebral depth electrodes in cortical and subcortical structures. We predicted the variability in betting behavior within and across patients by individual bias, which is estimated through a dynamical model of choice. Our analysis further revealed that high-frequency activity increased in the right hemisphere when participants were biased toward risky bets, while it increased in the left hemisphere when participants were biased away from risky bets. Our findings provide electrophysiological evidence that risk-taking bias is a lateralized push-pull neural system governing counterintuitive and highly variable decision-making in humans.},

@article{Shah2018,
abstract = {Objective: Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy are often candidates for invasive surgical therapies. In these patients, it is necessary to accurately localize seizure-generators to ensure seizure freedom following intervention. While intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is the gold standard for mapping networks for surgery, this approach requires inducing and recording seizures, which may cause patient morbidity. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of mapping interictal (non-seizure) iEEG networks to identify targets for surgical treatment. Methods: We analyze interictal iEEG recordings and neuroimaging from 27 focal epilepsy patients treated via surgical resection. We generate interictal functional networks by calculating pairwise correlation of iEEG signals across different frequency bands. We identify electrodes falling within surgically resected tissue (i.e. the resection zone), and compute node-level and edge-level synchrony in relation to the resection zone. We associate these metrics with post-surgical outcomes. Results: Greater overlap between resected electrodes and highly synchronous electrodes is associated with favorable post-surgical outcomes. Additionally, good outcome patients have significantly higher connectivity localized within the resection zone compared to those with poorer postoperative seizure control. This finding persists following normalization by a spatially-constrained null model. Conclusions: This study suggests that spatially-informed interictal network synchrony measures can distinguish between good and poor post-surgical outcomes. By capturing clinically relevant information during interictal periods, our method may ultimately reduce the need for prolonged invasive implants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of an epileptic brain. We discuss next steps for translating these findings into a prospectively useful clinical tool.},

abstract = {High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are recognized as biomarkers for epileptogenic brain tissue. A remaining challenge for epilepsy surgery is the prospective classification of tissue sampled by individual electrode contacts. We analysed long-term invasive recordings of 20 consecutive patients who subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery. HFOs were defined prospectively by a previously validated, automated algorithm in the ripple (80–250 Hz) and the fast ripple (FR, 250–500 Hz) frequency band. Contacts with the highest rate of ripples co-occurring with FR over several five-minute time intervals designated the HFO area. The HFO area was fully included in the resected area in all 13 patients who achieved seizure freedom (specificity 100{\%}) and in 3 patients where seizures reoccurred (negative predictive value 81{\%}). The HFO area was only partially resected in 4 patients suffering from recurrent seizures (positive predictive value 100{\%}, sensitivity 57{\%}). Thus, the resection of the prospectively defined HFO area proved to be highly specific and reproducible in 13/13 patients with seizure freedom, while it may have improved the outcome in 4/7 patients with recurrent seizures. We thus validated the clinical relevance of the HFO area in the individual patient with an automated procedure. This is a prerequisite before HFOs can guide surgical treatment in multicentre studies.},

abstract = {Ictal wave form characteristics — frequency, spatial distribution, and duration — were analyzed for 140 complex partial seizures recorded from epidural strip electrodes implanted in 28 patients. None had abnormalities on imaging studies. All had bilateral electrode placements, unilateral seizure onsets, temporal lobectomies, and were followed for a mean of 33 months postoperatively. Sixteen patients (57{\%}) became free of complex partial seizures: 12 had reductions in seizure frequency of a least 50{\%} but were not seizure-free. The only predictor of the seizure-free state was the presence of low voltage fast activity (LVF), in the alpha or beta ranges, localized to one gyrus. This phenomenon occurred in 14/16 seizure-free patients, 2/12 of others (P {\textless} 0.001). As seizures progressed, LVF typically increased in amplitude, propagated, and slowed into the theta range. Wave forms were classified into 8 categories based upon their frequency and morphology. Stepwise discriminant analysis of these wave forms, with consideration of whether they were localized or regional, revealed that both frequency and localization were critical for the post-surgical prognosis. The mere presence of a localized seizure onset was unreliable unless the wave form was taken into account. Well-localized rhythmic activity over 8 Hz at seizure onset from epidural subtemporal electrodes predicts surgical success. Slower rhythms imply greater separation in space and time from seizure onset.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns such as traveling waves are frequently observed in recordings of neural activity. The mechanisms underlying the generation of such patterns are largely unknown. Previous studies have investigated the existence and uniqueness of different types of waves or bumps of activity using neural-field models, phenomenological coarse-grained descriptions of neural-network dynamics. But it remains unclear how these insights can be transferred to more biologically realistic networks of spiking neurons, where individual neurons fire irregularly. Here, we employ mean-field theory to reduce a microscopic model of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with distance-dependent connectivity to an effective neural-field model. In contrast to existing phenomenological descriptions, the dynamics in this neural-field model depends on the mean and the variance in the synaptic input, both determining the amplitude and the temporal structure of the resulting effective coupling kernel. For the neural-field model we derive conditions for the existence of spatial and temporal oscillations and periodic traveling waves using linear stability analysis. We first prove that periodic traveling waves cannot occur in a single homogeneous population of neurons, irrespective of the form of distance dependence of the connection probability. Compatible with the architecture of cortical neural networks, traveling waves emerge in two-population networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as a combination of delay-induced temporal oscillations and spatial oscillations due to distance-dependent connectivity profiles. Finally, we demonstrate quantitative agreement between predictions of the analytically tractable neural-field model and numerical simulations of both networks of nonlinear rate-based units and networks of LIF neurons.},

It can be applied extraoperatively in patients undergoing intracranial EEG recordings using chronically implanted electrodes (subdural, depth or a combination), or it can be used intraoperatively. Seizures can be induced by CS but there is controversy regarding the utility of CS induced seizures in defining the epileptogenic zone and hence practice varies considerably between centres. Some centres use seizures induced by direct CS routinely to aid in defining the epileptogenic zone. In contrast, others do not rely on such information and explicitly avoid stimulating seizures during cortical mapping. Intra- and extraoperative techniques have been used to stimulate seizures with varying results, which may in part reflect these methodological differences. We here aim to review current views, definitions and studies on seizures induced by direct electrical CS. In addition we discuss mechanisms and methodological considerations of this procedure.},

Stimulation-induced seizures and EEG afterdischarges disrupt ESM procedure and render the interpretation of the results difficult. There are specific measures that can lessen the risk of seizures and afterdischarges during ESM. Electrical stimulation mapping procedure requires several tasks on the part of those conducting the procedure, such as operating the stimulator and the EEG recording equipment, administering behavioral or language tests and observing both patient and EEG responses to the stimulation. A team of experienced staff is necessary for individual assumption of each task. Knowledge of the spatial relationship between electrode contacts and underlying normal or abnormal brain structures is essential for interpreting ESM results. When testing for motor or sensory response, be aware of the distinction between responses at the primary motor area and responses at the supplementary sensorimotor area. The anatomy of supplementary sensorimotor area is more variable and functional than it is fixed and structural, although its general confines and somatotopic organization are known. In addition, negative motor responses to stimulation must be recognized to avoid misinterpretation of ESM results, especially in language mapping.},

abstract = {Objective: This study sought to determine whether certain aspects of after-discharges (ADs) obtained during cortical functional mapping provide better correlations between stimulus site and that of spontaneous seizures. Secondly, we wished to determine the percentage of stimulations evoking ADs and, of these, the percentage which clearly involves more than one electrode position, potentially inaccurately localizing cortical function. Thirdly, we wished to quantify the incidences of the several AD morphologies described by Jasper [in: Epilepsy and the functional anatomy of the human brain, 1954, p. 183; p. 692] and to assess whether certain morphologies had a greater tendency to evolve in frequency or morphology. Methods: In these 29 patients requiring invasive recordings to determine principal epileptogenic areas, only subdural strips were placed in 19 patients, only grids in 2 patients, and both in 8 patients. A median of 21 electrodes per patient was stimulated of a median of 63 electrodes placed, with the following parameters: biphasic, monopolar, 50 Hz, 0.3 ms pulse duration, 1.5-18 mA. Coverage involved the frontal and parietal lobes (9 patients), frontal parietal temporal lobes (8), frontal temporal (3), temporal (2), occipital (2) and occipital temporal (2) with other combinations in 3 additional patients. Classification of AD morphologies was determined by a pilot study using IFSECN definitions [Electroenceph clin Neurophysiol 1974;37:538] and descriptions by Jasper [in: Epilepsy and the functional anatomy of the human brain, 1954, p. 183] and Gloor [in: Advances in neurology, vol. 8, 1975; p. 59]. Results: Four hundred and two ADs (12{\%}) were elicited by 3358 trains of electrical stimuli of which 260 (65{\%}) clearly involved more than only the stimulated electrode position. Thus, 260 (8{\%}) of 3358 stimulations evoked an AD that could mislocalize cortical function. The proportion of stimulating electrodes eliciting ADs ranged among patients from 4 to 83{\%} (median 33{\%}). Polyspike bursts and sequential spikes were the most common AD morphologies. Ten percent of ADs evolved in morphology, frequency or both. Evolution occurred more commonly (44{\%}) with rhythmic waves than with other AD morphologies (7{\%}). Neither evolving ADs, ADs producing clinical seizures, or ADs exceeding 10 s correlated topologically with spontaneous seizure origins. Conclusions: Although occurring in a minority of cortical electrical stimuli, ADs may involve more than the stimulus site and therefore may inaccurately localize cortical function. Our material failed to disclose any consistent relationship between the site of stimulus eliciting ADs and that of spontaneously appearing seizures, even when certain aspects of such ADs were analysed. Significance: These data illustrate the need for scrutiny of the post-stimulus electrocorticogram for ADs and particularly those involving extra stimulus sites. Whether varying the stimulus parameters prospectively will disclose a better seizure localizing value for ADs remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that seizures can spread and terminate across brain areas via a rich diversity of spatiotemporal patterns. In particular, while the location of the seizure onset area is usually in-variant across seizures in a same patient, the source of traveling (2-3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) during seizures can either move with the slower propagating ictal wavefront or remain stationary at the seizure onset area. In addition, although most focal seizures terminate quasi-synchronously across brain areas, some evolve into distinct ictal clusters and terminate asynchronously. To provide a unifying perspective on the observed diversity of spatiotemporal dynamics for seizure spread and termination, we introduce here the Epileptor neural field model. Two mechanisms play an essential role. First, while the slow ictal wavefront propagates as a front in excitable neural media, the faster SWDs propagation results from coupled-oscillator dynamics. Second, multiple time scales interact during seizure spread, allowing for low-voltage fast-activity ({\textgreater}10 Hz) to hamper seizure spread and for SWD propagation to affect the way a seizure terminates. These dynamics, together with variations in short and long-range connectivity strength, play a central role on seizure spread, maintenance and termination. We demonstrate how Epileptor field models incorporating the above mechanisms predict the previously reported diversity in seizure spread patterns. Furthermore, we confirm the predictions for synchronous or asynchronous (clustered) seizure termination in human seizures recorded via stereotactic EEG. Our new insights into seizure spatiotemporal dynamics may also contribute to the development of new closed-loop neuromodulation therapies for focal epilepsy.},

A common peri-Sylvian cortex for motor and language functions is identified in the language dominant hemisphere, including sites common to sequencing of movements and identification of phonemes that may represent an anatomic substrate for the “motor theory of speech perception.” This is surrounded by sites related to short-term verbal memory, with sites specialized for such language functions as naming or syntax at the interface between these motor and memory areas. Language functions are discretely and differentially localized in association cortex, including some differential localization of the same function, naming, in multiple languages. There is substantial individual variability in the exact location of sites related to a particular function, a variability which can be partly related to the patient's sex and overall language ability and which may depend on prior brain injury and, perhaps subtly, on prior experience. A common “specific alerting response” mechanism for motor and language functions is identified in the lateral thalamus of the language–dominant hemisphere, a mechanism that may select the cortical areas appropriate for a particular language function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

abstract = {While there is a strong interest in meso-scale field potential recording using intracranial electroencephalography with penetrating depth electrodes (i.e. stereotactic EEG or S-EEG) in humans, the signal recorded in the white matter remains ignored. White matter is generally considered electrically neutral and often included in the reference montage. Moreover, re-referencing electrophysiological data is a critical preprocessing choice that could drastically impact signal content and consequently the results of any given analysis. In the present stereotactic electroencephalography study, we first illustrate empirically the consequences of commonly used references (subdermal, white matter, global average, local montage) on inter-electrode signal correlation. Since most of these reference montages incorporate white matter signal, we next consider the difference between signals recorded in cortical gray matter and white matter. Our results reveal that electrode contacts located in the white matter record a mixture of activity, with part arising from the volume conduction (zero time delay) of activity from nearby gray matter. Furthermore, our analysis shows that white matter signal may be correlated with distant gray matter signal. While residual passive electrical spread from nearby matter may account for this relationship, our results suggest the possibility that this long distance correlation arises from the white matter fiber tracts themselves (i.e. activity from distant gray matter traveling along axonal fibers with time lag larger than zero); yet definitive conclusions about the origin of the white matter signal would require further experimental substantiation. By characterizing the properties of signals recorded in white matter and in gray matter, this study illustrates the importance of including anatomical prior knowledge when analyzing S-EEG data.},

abstract = {Electrical source imaging (ESI) from interictal scalp EEG is increasingly validated and used as a valuable tool in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy as a reflection of the irritative zone. ESI of ictal scalp EEG to localize the seizure onset zone (SOZ) remains challenging. We investigated the value of an approach for ictal imaging using ESI and functional connectivity analysis (FC). Ictal scalp EEG from 111 seizures in 27 patients who had Engel class I outcome at least 1 year following resective surgery was analyzed. For every seizure, an artifact-free epoch close to the seizure onset was selected and ESI using LORETA was applied. In addition, the reconstructed sources underwent FC using the spectrum-weighted Adaptive Directed Transfer Function. This resulted in the estimation of the SOZ in two ways: (i) the source with maximal power after ESI, (ii) the source with the strongest outgoing connections after combined ESI and FC. Next, we calculated the distance between the estimated SOZ and the border of the resected zone (RZ) for both approaches and called this the localization error ((i) LEpowand (ii) LEconnrespectively). By comparing LEpowand LEconn, we assessed the added value of FC. The source with maximal power after ESI was inside the RZ (LEpow= 0 mm) in 31{\%} of the seizures and estimated within 10 mm from the border of the RZ (LEpow≤ 10 mm) in 42{\%}. Using ESI and FC, these numbers increased to 72{\%} for LEconn= 0 mm and 94{\%} for LEconn≤ 10 mm. FC provided a significant added value to ESI alone (p {\textless} 0.001). ESI combined with subsequent FC is able to localize the SOZ in a non-invasive way with high accuracy. Therefore it could be a valuable tool in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy.},

Using simultaneous video recording, we analysed scalp EEG activity during ictal periods in 38 patients (30 patients with medial TLE (MTLE) and eight with lateral TLE (LTLE)). In 14 patients, intracranial ictal EEGs were recorded with depth electrodes, and simultaneous recordings of scalp and intracranial EEG were performed in 11 patients. Scalp EEG showed that, in all 30 patients with MTLE (71 of 72 seizures), an attenuation of background activity was observed before the appearance of ictal activity. Ictal discharges first appeared in the scalp EEG when the ictal discharges reached the lateral part of the temporal lobe on the intracranial EEG. While, in all eight patients with LTLE (25 of 25 seizures), the attenuation of background activity did not occur before the appearance of ictal activity. When the ictal discharges started in the lateral temporal lobe on intracranial EEG, ictal discharges appeared on the scalp. MTLE and LTLE could be diagnosed by the presence or absence of attenuation of background activity with clinical ictal signs before the appearance of ictal discharges. {\textcopyright} 2002 BEA Trading Ltd.

abstract = {UNLABELLED Measurements of neuronal signals during human seizure activity and evoked epileptic activity in experimental models suggest that, in these pathological states, the individual nerve cells experience an activity driven depolarization block, i.e. they saturate. We examined the effect of such a saturation in the Wilson-Cowan formalism by adapting the nonlinear activation function; we substituted the commonly applied sigmoid for a Gaussian function. We discuss experimental recordings during a seizure that support this substitution. Next we perform a bifurcation analysis on the Wilson-Cowan model with a Gaussian activation function. The main effect is an additional stable equilibrium with high excitatory and low inhibitory activity. Analysis of coupled local networks then shows that such high activity can stay localized or spread. Specifically, in a spatial continuum we show a wavefront with inhibition leading followed by excitatory activity. We relate our model simulations to observations of spreading activity during seizures.

By incorporating conservation of particles and charge, and accounting for the energy required to restore ionic gradients, we extend the classic Hodgkin-Huxley formalism to uncover a unification of neuronal membrane dynamics. By examining the dynamics as a function of potassium and oxygen, we now account for a wide range of neuronal activities, from spikes to seizures, spreading depression (whether high potassium or hypoxia induced), mixed seizure and spreading depression states, and the terminal anoxic "wave of death." Such a unified framework demonstrates that all of these dynamics lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane. Our results demonstrate that unified frameworks for neuronal dynamics are feasible, can be achieved using existing biological structures and universal physical conservation principles, and may be of substantial importance in enabling our understanding of brain activity and in the control of pathological states.},

abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy tends to reshape the language system causing maladaptive reorganization that can be characterized by task-based functional MRI, and eventually can contribute to surgical decision making processes. However, the dynamic interacting nature of the brain as a complex system is often neglected, with many studies treating the language system as a static monolithic structure. Here, we demonstrate that as a specialized and integrated system, the language network is inherently dynamic, characterized by rich patterns of regional interactions, whose transient dynamics are disrupted in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Specifically, we applied tools from dynamic network neuroscience to functional MRI data collected from 50 temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 30 matched healthy controls during performance of a verbal fluency task, as well as during rest. By assigning 16 language-related regions into four subsystems (i.e. bilateral frontal and temporal), we observed regional specialization in both the probability of transient interactions and the frequency of such changes, in both healthy controls and patients during task performance but not rest. Furthermore, we found that both left and right temporal lobe epilepsy patients displayed reduced interactions within the left frontal 'core' subsystem compared to the healthy controls, while left temporal lobe epilepsy patients were unique in showing enhanced interactions between the left frontal 'core' and the right temporal subsystems. Also, both patient groups displayed reduced flexibility in the transient interactions of the left temporal and right frontal subsystems, which formed the 'periphery' of the language network. Importantly, such group differences were again evident only during task condition. Lastly, through random forest regression, we showed that dynamic reconfiguration of the language system tracks individual differences in verbal fluency with superior prediction accuracy compared to traditional activation-based static measures. Our results suggest dynamic network measures may be an effective biomarker for detecting the language dysfunction associated with neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy, specifying both the type of neuronal communications that are missing in these patients and those that are potentially added but maladaptive. Further advancements along these lines, transforming how we characterize and map language networks in the brain, have a high probability of altering clinical decision making in neurosurgical centres.10.1093/brain/awy042{\_}video1awy042media15754656112001.},

METHODS Guided by previous SEEG intracranial data, a laser ablation probe was inserted by using a robotic guidance device in a 17-yr-old medically refractory epilepsy patient with difficult to localize seizures and nonlesional MRI. The laser applicator position was confirmed by MRI, targeting the left mesial rostral superior frontal gyrus. The ablation was performed under multiplanar digital imaging views and real-time thermal imaging and treatment estimates in each plane. A postablation MRI (contrasted T1 sequence) confirmed the ablation's location and size. RESULTS The entire procedure was achieved in approximately 100 min. The actual ablation was performed in less than 3 min. Approximately, additional 30 min preoperatively were used for positioning and robot registration. Precise placement of laser application (in comparison with preplanned trajectories) was achieved using the robotic guidance and confirmed by the intraoperative magnetic resonance images. No complications were reported. The patient has been seizure-free since surgery. The follow-up period is 20 mo. Two additional patients, treated with similar methodology, are also described. CONCLUSION The preliminary experience with the described method shows the feasibility of a unique combination of the SEEG methodology with laser thermocoagulation in patients with neocortical MRI-negative pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy to treat movement disorders including essential tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease. Despite over a decade of clinical experience the mechanisms of DBS are still unclear, and this lack of understanding makes the selection of stimulation parameters quite challenging. The objective of this work was to develop a closed-loop control system that automatically adjusted the stimulation amplitude to reduce oscillatory neuronal activity, based on feedback of electrical signals recorded from the brain using the same electrode as implanted for stimulation. We simulated a population of 100 intrinsically active model neurons in the Vim thalamus, and the local field potentials (LFPs) generated by the population were used as the feedback (control) variable for closed loop control of DBS amplitude. Based on the correlation between the spectral content of the thalamic activity and tremor (Hua et al., 1998), (Lenz et al., 1988), we implemented an adaptive minimum variance controller to regulate the power spectrum of the simulated LFPs and restore the LFP power spectrum present under tremor conditions to a reference profile derived under tremor free conditions. The controller was based on a recursively identified autoregressive model (ARX) of the relationship between stimulation input and LFP output, and showed excellent performances in tracking the reference spectral features through selective changes in the theta (2-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) frequency ranges. Such changes reflected modifications in the firing patterns of the model neuronal population, and, differently from open-loop DBS, replaced the tremor-related pathological patterns with patterns similar to those simulated in tremor-free conditions. The closed-loop controller generated a LFP spectrum that approximated more closely the spectrum present in the tremor-free condition than did open loop fixed intensity stimulation and adapted to match the spectrum after a change in the neuronal oscillation frequency. This computational study suggests the feasibility of closed-loop control of DBS amplitude to regulate the spectrum of the local field potentials and thereby normalize the aberrant pattern of neuronal activity present in tremor. Index Terms-Autoregressive model (ARX), deep brain stimulation (DBS), essential tremor, local field potentials, minimum variance control, Parkinson's disease, recursive least-squares (RLS) identification.

abstract = {The stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) stated by Steyn-Ross and co-workers constitute a model of mesoscopic electrical activity of the human cortex. A simplification in which spatial variation and stochastic input are neglected yields ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are amenable to analysis by techniques of dynamical systems theory. Bifurcation diagrams are developed for the ODEs with increased subcortical excitation, showing that the model predicts oscillatory electrical activity in a large range of parameters. The full SPDEs with increased subcortical excitation produce travelling waves of electrical activity. These model results are compared with electrocortical data recorded at two subdural electrodes from a human subject undergoing a seizure. The model and observational results agree in two important respects during seizure: (i) the average frequency of maximum power, and (ii) the speed of spatial propagation of voltage peaks. This suggests that seizing activity on the human cortex may be understood as an example of pathological pattern formation. Included is a discussion of the applications and limitations of these results.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy, feasibility and clinical value of both ictal and interictal 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Methods: The study included 75 consecutive patients, 48 with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE group), and 27 with extratemporal epilepsy (ExT group). The accuracy of SPECT was analyzed considering the final diagnosis reached by convergence of clinical, electrophysiologic, structural, pathologic and outcome data. Results: Ictal SPECT correctly identified the epileptogenic zone in 21 (91.3{\%}) of 23 patients, whereas interictal SPECTs could correctly identify the epileptogenic zone in only 41 (62.1{\%}) of 66 patients ($\chi$2 = 5.56, df = 1, p {\textless} 0.05). Results were similar when the two study groups were analyzed separately. Moreover, ictal studies had significantly higher specificity (91.3 vs. 60.6{\%}) and positive predictive value (91.3 vs. 66.2{\%}) than interictal studies for the whole series of patients. Considering all tools used in the preoperative workup of these patients, ictal SPECT significantly contributed to the final topographic diagnosis in seven of 14 patients from TLE group and in six of nine patients from the ExT group. In these patients, ictal SPECT either obviated the need for invasive EEG or helped to define where to concentrate the efforts of invasive investigation. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that ictal SPECT can be easily achieved by using 99mTc-ECD and can accurately localize the epileptogenic zone in both temporal and extratemporal epilepsies. Ictal ECD SPECT proved to be significantly more sensitive and specific than interictal ECD SPECT, and clinically useful in the definition of the epileptogenic zone.},

abstract = {Precise segmentation is a prerequisite for an accurate quantification of the imaged objects. It is a very challenging task in many medical imaging applications due to relatively poor image quality and data scarcity. In this work, we present an innovative segmentation paradigm, named Deep Poincare Map (DPM), by coupling the dynamical system theory with a novel deep learning based approach. Firstly, we model the image segmentation process as a dynamical system, in which limit cycle models the boundary of the region of interest (ROI). Secondly, instead of segmenting the ROI directly, convolutional neural network is employed to predict the vector field of the dynamical system. Finally, the boundary of the ROI is identified using the Poincare map and the flow integration. We demonstrate that our segmentation model can be built using a very limited number of train- ing data. By cross-validation, we can achieve a mean Dice score of 94{\%} compared to the manual delineation (ground truth) of the left ventricle ROI defined by clinical experts on a cardiac MRI dataset. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, we can conclude that the proposed DPM method is adaptive, accurate and robust. It is straightforward to apply this method for other medical imaging applications.},

@article{Kalman1960,
abstract = {Introduction AN IMPORTANT class of theoretical and practical problems in communication and control is of a statistical nature. Such problems are: (i) Prediction of random signals; (ii) separation of random signals from random noise; (iii) detection of signals of known form (pulses, sinusoids) in the presence of random noise. In his pioneering work, Wiener [1] 3 showed that problems (i) and (ii) lead to the so-called Wiener-Hopf integral equation; he also gave a method (spectral factorization) for the solution of this integral equation in the practically important special case of stationary statistics and rational spectra. Many extensions and generalizations followed Wiener's basic work. Zadeh and Ragazzini solved the finite-memory case [2]. Concurrently and independently of Bode and Shannon [3], they also gave a simplified method [2] of solution. Booton discussed the nonstationary Wiener-Hopf equation [4]. These results are now in standard texts [5-6]. A somewhat different approach along these main lines has been given recently by Darlington [7]. For extensions to sampled signals, see, e.g., Franklin [8], Lees [9]. Another approach based on the eigenfunctions of the Wiener-Hopf equation (which applies also to nonstationary problems whereas the preceding methods in general don't), has been pioneered by Davis [10] and applied by many others, e.g., Shinbrot [11], Blum [12], Pugachev [13], Solodovnikov [14]. In all these works, the objective is to obtain the specification of a linear dynamic system (Wiener filter) which accomplishes the prediction, separation, or detection of a random signal. 4-Present methods for solving the Wiener problem are subject to a number of limitations which seriously curtail their practical usefulness: (1) The optimal filter is specified by its impulse response. It is not a simple task to synthesize the filter from such data. (2) Numerical determination of the optimal impulse response is often quite involved and poorly suited to machine computation. The situation gets rapidly worse with increasing complexity of the problem. (3) Important generalizations (e.g., growing-memory filters, nonstationary prediction) require new derivations, frequently of considerable difficulty to the nonspecialist. (4) The mathematics of the derivations are not transparent. Fundamental assumptions and their consequences tend to be obscured. This paper introduces a new look at this whole assemblage of problems, sidestepping the difficulties just mentioned. The following are the highlights of the paper: (5) Optimal Estimates and Orthogonal Projections. The Wiener problem is approached from the point of view of conditional distributions and expectations. In this way, basic facts of the Wiener theory are quickly obtained; the scope of the results and the fundamental assumptions appear clearly. It is seen that all statistical calculations and results are based on first and second order averages; no other statistical data are needed. Thus difficulty (4) is eliminated. This method is well known in probability theory (see pp. 75-78 and 148-155 of Doob [15] and pp. 455-464 of Lo{\`{e}}ve [16]) but has not yet been used extensively in engineering. (6) Models for Random Processes. Following, in particular, Bode and Shannon [3], arbitrary random signals are represented (up to second order average statistical properties) as the output of a linear dynamic system excited by independent or uncorrelated random signals ("white noise"). This is a standard trick in the engineering applications of the Wiener theory [2-7]. The approach taken here differs from the conventional one only in the way in which linear dynamic systems are described. We shall emphasize the concepts of state and state transition; in other words, linear systems will be specified by systems of first-order difference (or differential) equations. This point of view is A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems 1 The classical filtering and prediction problem is reexamined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the "state transition" method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the coefficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

abstract = {Purpose: To estimate the spatially varying noise map using a redundant series of magnitude MR images. Methods: We exploit redundancy in non-Gaussian distributed multidirectional diffusion MRI data by identifying its noise-only principal components, based on the theory of noisy covariance matrices. The bulk of principal component analysis eigenvalues, arising due to noise, is described by the universal Marchenko–Pastur distribution, parameterized by the noise level. This allows us to estimate noise level in a local neighborhood based on the singular value decomposition of a matrix combining neighborhood voxels and diffusion directions. Results: We present a model-independent local noise mapping method capable of estimating the noise level down to about 1{\%} error. In contrast to current state-of-the-art techniques, the resultant noise maps do not show artifactual anatomical features that often reflect physiological noise, the presence of sharp edges, or a lack of adequate a priori knowledge of the expected form of MR signal. Conclusions: Simulations and experiments show that typical diffusion MRI data exhibit sufficient redundancy that enables accurate, precise, and robust estimation of the local noise level by interpreting the principal component analysis eigenspectrum in terms of the Marchenko–Pastur distribution.

abstract = {Diffusion MRI streamlines tractography allows for the investigation of the brain white matter pathways non-invasively. However a fundamental limitation of this technology is its non-quantitative nature, i.e. the density of reconstructed connections is not reflective of the density of underlying white matter fibres. As a solution to this problem, we have previously published the “spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT)” method, which determines a subset of the streamlines reconstruction such that the streamlines densities throughout the white matter are as close as possible to fibre densities estimated using the spherical deconvolution diffusion model; this permits the use of streamline count as a valid biological marker of connection density. Particular aspects of its performance may have however limited its uptake in the diffusion MRI research community. Here we present an alternative to this method, entitled SIFT2, which provides a more logically direct and computationally efficient solution to the streamlines connectivity quantification problem: by determining an appropriate cross-sectional area multiplier for each streamline rather than removing streamlines altogether, biologically accurate measures of fibre connectivity are obtained whilst making use of the complete streamlines reconstruction.},

abstract = {Typically in neuroimaging we are looking to extract some pertinent information from imperfect, noisy images of the brain. This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors.

abstract = {Defining a bio-electrical marker for the brain area responsible for initiating a seizure remains an unsolved problem. Fast gamma activity has been identified as the most specific marker for seizure onset, but conflicting results have been reported. In this study, we describe an alternative marker, based on an objective description of interictal to ictal transition, with the aim of identifying a time-frequency pattern or ‘fingerprint' that can differentiate the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation. Seventeen patients who underwent stereoelectroencephalography were included in the study. Each had seizure onset characterized by sustained gamma activity and were seizure-free after tailored resection or laser ablation. We postulated that the epileptogenic zone was always located inside the resection region based on seizure freedom following surgery. To characterize the ictal frequency pattern, we applied the Morlet wavelet transform to data from each pair of adjacent intracerebral electrode contacts. Based on a visual assessment of the time-frequency plots, we hypothesized that a specific time-frequency pattern in the epileptogenic zone should include a combination of (i) sharp transients or spikes; preceding (ii) multiband fast activity concurrent; with (iii) suppression of lower frequencies. To test this hypothesis, we developed software that automatically extracted each of these features from the time-frequency data. We then used a support vector machine to classify each contact-pair as being within epileptogenic zone or not, based on these features. Our machine learning system identified this pattern in 15 of 17 patients. The total number of identified contacts across all patients was 64, with 58 localized inside the resected area. Subsequent quantitative analysis showed strong correlation between maximum frequency of fast activity and suppression inside the resection but not outside. We did not observe significant discrimination power using only the maximum frequency or the timing of fast activity to differentiate contacts either between resected and non-resected regions or between contacts identified as epileptogenic versus non-epileptogenic. Instead of identifying a single frequency or a single timing trait, we observed the more complex pattern described above that distinguishes the epileptogenic zone. This pattern encompasses interictal to ictal transition and may extend until seizure end. Its time-frequency characteristics can be explained in light of recent models emphasizing the role of fast inhibitory interneurons acting on pyramidal cells as a prominent mechanism in seizure triggering. The pattern clearly differentiates the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation and, as such, represents an epileptogenic zone ‘fingerprint'.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE We performed a retrospective study to determine the different types of seizure onset patterns (SOP) in invasive EEG (IEEG) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHODS We analyzed a group of 51 patients (158 seizures) with TLE who underwent IEEG. We analyzed the dominant frequency during the first 3s after the onset of ictal activity. The cut-off value for distinguishing between fast and slow frequencies was 8 Hz. We defined three types of SOPs: (1) fast ictal activity (FIA) - frequency ≥8 Hz; (2) slow ictal activity (SIA) - frequency {\textless}8 Hz; and (3) attenuation of background activity (AT) - no clear-cut rhythmic activity during the first 3s associated with changes of IEEG signal (increase of frequency, decrease of amplitude). We tried to find the relationship between different SOP types and surgery outcome, histopathological findings, and SOZ localization. RESULTS The most frequent SOP was FIA, which was present in 67{\%} of patients. More patients with FIA were classified postoperatively as Engel I than those with SIA and AT (85{\%} vs. 31{\%} vs. 0) (P {\textless} 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the type of SOP, in the histopathological findings, or in the SOZ localization. CONCLUSION In patients with refractory TLE, seizure onset frequencies ≥8 Hz during the first 3s of ictal activity are associated with a better surgical outcome than frequencies {\textless}8 Hz. SIGNIFICANCE Our study suggests that very early seizure onset frequencies in IEEG in patients with TLE could be the independent predictive factor for their outcome, regardless of the localization and etiology.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
High-frequency oscillations (80–500Hz; HFOs) have been shown to be a specific biomarker of the seizure-onset zone. The relationship of HFOs with seizures having different intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) morphological onsets, however, has shown significant relationships in experimental animals but has not been studied in humans. We investigated how interictal and ictal HFOs relate to different seizure-onset morphological patterns. 

METHODS
We analyzed the most representative seizure type of 37 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent iEEG for diagnostic evaluation. According to the morphology, 211 seizure-onset zone channels were classified in six patterns (low-voltage fast activity; sharp activity at ≤13Hz; low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spikes; burst of high-amplitude polyspikes; spike-and-wave activity; and delta brush). Interictal and ictal HFOs were compared between the six seizure-onset patterns. 

RESULTS
Interictal ripple and fast ripple rates differed significantly across seizure-onset patterns (p{\textless}0.001). Significant differences were also found for ictal HFOs density across the different seizure-onset patterns (p{\textless}0.001). Sharp activity at ≤13Hz was associated with the lowest interictal HFO rate suggesting either that the mechanism that generates this type of EEG morphology do not generate HFOs or possibly that this pattern is more likely to be generated in a region of seizure spread. Regarding the difference in HFO density between pre-ictal baseline and seizure-onset section across the six patterns, burst of high-amplitude polyspikes and delta brushes had the highest densities of both ripples and fast ripples (p{\textless}0.001). 

SIGNIFICANCE
We demonstrated that distinct seizure-onset patterns correlate specific interictal and ictal HFO profiles confirming that seizures with different morphological patterns likely have different mechanisms of generation. This study emphazises that, in clinical practice, seizure-onset patterns should be distinguished and specified when analyzing HFOs, particularly if they are used in presurgical evaluation to better localize the seizure-onset zone.},

abstract = {Because seizures originate from different pathological substrates, the question arises of whether distinct or similar mechanisms underlie seizure generation across different pathologies. Better defining intracranial electroencephalographic morphological patterns at seizure-onset could improve the understanding of such mechanisms. To this end, we investigated intracranial electroencephalographic seizure-onset patterns associated with different epileptogenic lesions, and defined high-frequency oscillation correlates of each pattern. We analysed representative seizure types from 33 consecutive patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and a structural magnetic resonance imaging lesion (11 mesial temporal sclerosis, nine focal cortical dysplasia, six cortical atrophy, three periventricular nodular heterotopia, three polymicrogyria, and one tuberous sclerosis complex) who underwent depth-electrode electroencephalographic recordings (500 Hz filter, 2000 Hz sampling rate). Patients were included only if seizures arose from contacts located in lesional/peri-lesional tissue, and if clinical manifestations followed the electrographic onset. Seizure-onset patterns were defined independently by two reviewers blinded to clinical information, and consensus was reached after discussion. For each seizure, pre-ictal and ictal sections were selected for high-frequency oscillation analysis. Seven seizure-onset patterns were identified across the 53 seizures sampled: low-voltage fast activity (43{\%}); low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spikes (21{\%}); sharp activity at ≤13 Hz (15{\%}); spike-and-wave activity (9{\%}); burst of high-amplitude polyspikes (6{\%}); burst suppression (4{\%}); and delta brush (4{\%}). Each pattern occurred across several pathologies, except for periodic spikes, only observed with mesial temporal sclerosis, and delta brush, exclusive to focal cortical dysplasia. However, mesial temporal sclerosis was not always associated with periodic spikes nor focal cortical dysplasia with delta brush. Compared to other patterns, low-voltage fast activity was associated with a larger seizure-onset zone (P = 0.04). Four patterns, sharp activity at ≤13 Hz, low-voltage fast activity, spike-and-wave activity and periodic spikes, were also found in regions of seizure spread, with periodic spikes only emerging from mesial temporal sclerosis. Each of the seven patterns was accompanied by a significant increase in high-frequency oscillations upon seizure-onset. Overall, our data indicate that: (i) biologically-distinct epileptogenic lesions share intracranial electroencephalographic seizure-onset patterns, suggesting that different pathological substrates can affect similarly networks or mechanisms underlying seizure generation; (ii) certain pathologies are associated with intracranial electroencephalographic signatures at seizure-onset, e.g. periodic spikes which may reflect mechanisms specific to mesial temporal sclerosis; (iii) some seizure-onset patterns, including periodic spikes, can also be found in regions of spread, which cautions against relying on the morphology of the initial discharge to define the epileptogenic zone; and (iv) high-frequency oscillations increase at seizure-onset, independently of the pattern.},

In this paper, we focus on brain imaging data, including both calcium imaging and functional MRI data. Standard vector-autoregressive models are limited by their linearity assumptions, while nonlinear general-purpose, large-scale temporal models, such as LSTM networks, typically require large amounts of training data, not always readily available in biological applications; furthermore, such models have limited interpretability. We introduce here a novel approach for learning a nonlinear differential equation model aimed at capturing brain dynamics. Specifically, we propose a variable-projection optimization approach to estimate the parameters of the multivariate (coupled) van der Pol oscillator, and demonstrate that such a model can accurately represent nonlinear dynamics of the brain data. Furthermore, in order to improve the predictive accuracy when forecasting future brain-activity time series, we use this analytical model as an unlimited source of simulated data for pretraining LSTM; such model-specific data augmentation approach consistently improves LSTM performance on both calcium and fMRI imaging data.},

Physiological activity interspersed with epochs of pathological hyperactivity in the epileptic brain represents a clinically relevant yet poorly understood case of such rich dynamic repertoire. Using a realistic computational model, we demonstrate that physiological sparse and pathological tonic-clonic activity may coexist in the same cortical network for identical afferent input level. Transient perturbations in the afferent input were sufficient to switch the network between these two stable states. The effectiveness of the potassium regulatory apparatus determined the stability of the physiological state and the threshold for seizure initiation. Our findings contrast with the common notions of (1) pathological brain activity representing dynamic instabilities and (2) necessary adjustments of experimental conditions to elicit different network states. Rather, we propose that the rich dynamic repertoire of cortical networks may be based on multistabilities intrinsic to the network.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The occurrence of abnormal dynamics in a physiological system can become manifest as a sudden qualitative change in the behavior of characteristic physiologic variables. We assume that this is what happens in the brain with regard to epilepsy. We consider that neuronal networks involved in epilepsy possess multistable dynamics (i.e., they may display several dynamic states). To illustrate this concept, we may assume, for simplicity, that at least two states are possible: an interictal one characterized by a normal, apparently random, steady-state of ongoing activity, and another one that is characterized by the paroxysmal occurrence of a synchronous oscillations (seizure). METHODS By using the terminology of the mathematics of nonlinear systems, we can say that such a bistable system has two attractors, to which the trajectories describing the system's output converge, depending on initial conditions and on the system's parameters. In phase-space, the basins of attraction corresponding to the two states are separated by what is called a "separatrix." We propose, schematically, that the transition between the normal ongoing and the seizure activity can take place according to three basic models: Model I: In certain epileptic brains (e.g., in absence seizures of idiopathic primary generalized epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is very small in contrast to that of a normal brain (possibly due to genetic and/or developmental factors). In the former, discrete random fluctuations of some variables can be sufficient for the occurrence of a transition to the paroxysmal state. In this case, such seizures are not predictable. Model II and model III: In other kinds of epileptic brains (e.g., limbic cortex epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is, in general, rather large, such that random fluctuations, of themselves, are commonly not capable of triggering a seizure. However, in these brains, neuronal networks have abnormal features characterized by unstable parameters that are very vulnerable to the influence of endogenous (model II) and/or exogenous (model III) factors. In these cases, these critical parameters may gradually change with time, in such a way that the attractor can deform either gradually or suddenly, with the consequence that the distance between the basin of attraction of the normal state and the separatrix tends to zero. This can lead, eventually, to a transition to a seizure. RESULTS The changes of the system's dynamics preceding a seizure in these models either may be detectable in the EEG and thus the route to the seizure may be predictable, or may be unobservable by using only measurements of the dynamical state. It is thinkable, however, that in some cases, changes in the excitability state of the underlying networks may be uncovered by using appropriate stimuli configurations before changes in the dynamics of the ongoing EEG activity are evident. A typical example of model III that we discuss here is photosensitive epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS We present an overview of these basic models, based on neurophysiologic recordings combined with signal analysis and on simulations performed by using computational models of neuronal networks. We pay especial attention to recent model studies and to novel experimental results obtained while analyzing EEG features preceding limbic seizures and during intermittent photic stimulation that precedes the transition to paroxysmal epileptic activity.},

Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique that shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes.

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind. {\textcopyright} 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The generators and discriminators are trained together using adversarial learning. Under mild assumptions, in theory the joint distributions characterized by the two generators concentrate to the data distribution.

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

abstract = {There is an emerging trend to leverage noisy image datasets in many visual recognition tasks. However, the label noise among the datasets severely degenerates the $\backslash$mbox{\{}performance of deep{\}} learning approaches. Recently, one mainstream is to introduce the latent label to handle label noise, which has shown promising improvement in the network designs. Nevertheless, the mismatch between latent labels and noisy labels still affects the predictions in such methods. To address this issue, we propose a quality embedding model, which explicitly introduces a quality variable to represent the trustworthiness of noisy labels. Our key idea is to identify the mismatch between the latent and noisy labels by embedding the quality variables into different subspaces, which effectively minimizes the noise effect. At the same time, the high-quality labels is still able to be applied for training. To instantiate the model, we further propose a Contrastive-Additive Noise network (CAN), which consists of two important layers: (1) the contrastive layer estimates the quality variable in the embedding space to reduce noise effect; and (2) the additive layer aggregates the prior predictions and noisy labels as the posterior to train the classifier. Moreover, to tackle the optimization difficulty, we deduce an SGD algorithm with the reparameterization tricks, which makes our method scalable to big data. We conduct the experimental evaluation of the proposed method over a range of noisy image datasets. Comprehensive results have demonstrated CAN outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.},

abstract = {Over the last few years deep learning methods have emerged as one of the most prominent approaches for video analysis. However, so far their most successful applications have been in the area of video classification and detection, i.e., problems involving the prediction of a single class label or a handful of output variables per video. Furthermore, while deep networks are commonly recognized as the best models to use in these domains, there is a widespread perception that in order to yield successful results they often require time-consuming architecture search, manual tweaking of parameters and computationally intensive pre-processing or post-processing methods. In this paper we challenge these views by presenting a deep 3D convolutional architecture trained end to end to perform voxel-level prediction, i.e., to output a variable at every voxel of the video. Most importantly, we show that the same exact architecture can be used to achieve competitive results on three widely different voxel-prediction tasks: video semantic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and video coloring. The three networks learned on these problems are trained from raw video without any form of preprocessing and their outputs do not require post-processing to achieve outstanding performance. Thus, they offer an efficient alternative to traditional and much more computationally expensive methods in these video domains.},

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC Challenge datasets, plateaued in the final years of the competition. The best-performing methods were complex ensemble systems that typically combined multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 50 percent relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012—achieving a mAP of 62.4 percent. Our approach combines two ideas: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data are scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, boosts performance significantly. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/{\~{}}rbg/rcnn.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for learning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of recent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical images. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective. In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a generalized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We demonstrate the computational efficiency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness of spherical CNNs applied to 3D model recognition and atomization energy regression.},

abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For {\$}300\backslashtimes 300{\$} input, SSD achieves 72.1{\%} mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for {\$}500\backslashtimes 500{\$} input, SSD achieves 75.1{\%} mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ﬁrst observe the inﬂuence of the non-linear activations functions. We ﬁnd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ﬁnd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneﬁcial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difﬁcult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic {\~{}}EOG! recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally, regressing out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant EEG signals from each record as well.

Use of principal component analysis {\~{}}PCA! has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel EEG.

Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.},

abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

Experiments in macaques demonstrate an extraordinarily simple transformation between faces and responses of cells in face patches. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, we discovered that each face cell's firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble to encode the location of any face in the space. Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells. Our work suggests that other objects could be encoded by analogous metric coordinate systems. PaperClip},

In this work we propose and evaluate several deep neural network architectures to combine image infor-mation across a video over longer time periods than previ-ously attempted. We propose two methods capable of han-dling full length videos. The first method explores various convolutional temporal feature pooling architectures, ex-amining the various design choices which need to be made when adapting a CNN for this task. The second proposed method explicitly models the video as an ordered sequence of frames. For this purpose we employ a recurrent neural network that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells which are connected to the output of the underlying CNN. Our best networks exhibit significant performance improve-ments over previously published results on the Sports 1 mil-lion dataset (73.1{\%} vs. 60.9{\%}) and the UCF-101 datasets with (88.6{\%} vs. 88.0{\%}) and without additional optical flow information (82.6{\%} vs. 73.0{\%}).},

abstract = {Minimization with orthogonality constraints (e.g., X X = I) and/or spherical constraints (e.g., x 2 = 1) has wide applications in polynomial optimization, combinatorial optimization, eigenvalue problems, sparse PCA, p-harmonic flows, 1-bit compressive sensing, matrix rank minimization, etc. These problems are difficult because the constraints are not only non-convex but numerically expensive to preserve during iterations. To deal with these difficulties, we apply the Cayley transform — a Crank-Nicolson-like update scheme — to preserve the constraints and based on it, develop curvilinear search algorithms with lower flops compared to those based on projections and geodesics. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a variety of test problems. In particular, for the maxcut problem, it exactly solves a decomposition formulation for the SDP relaxation. For polynomial optimization, nearest correlation matrix estimation and extreme eigenvalue problems, the proposed algorithms run very fast and return solutions no worse than those from their state-of-the-art algorithms. For the quadratic assignment problem, a gap 0.842{\%} to the best known solution on the largest problem " tai256c " in QAPLIB can be reached in 5 minutes on a typical laptop.},

The etiology of epilepsy is unclear, but a common theme among proposed mechanisms is that structural connectivity between neurons is altered. It is hypothesized that epilepsy arises not from random changes in connectivity, but from specific structural changes to the most fragile nodes or neurons in the network. In this letter, the minimum energy perturbation on functional connectivity required to destabilize linear networks is derived. Perturbation results are then applied to a probabilistic nonlinear neural network model that operates at a stable fixed point.

Enhanced [Ca2+]o concentration changes are also observed in chronic epilepsies such as the chronic alumina cream and cobalt focus, the kindling epilepsy, and during photically induced seizures in the baboon Papio papio. In chronic epilepsies, the sites of maximal [Ca2+]o changes shift to other layers, suggesting changes in the distribution of ion channels over the surface of nerve cells that may be involved in epileptogenesis in chronic epilepsies. The K+ and Ca2+ concentration changes associated with seizure contribute to the generation and spread of epileptic activity.

abstract = {Epilepsy is an abnormal brain state in which a large population of neurons is synchronously active, causing an enormous increase in metabolic demand. Recent investigations using highresolution imaging techniques, such as optical recording of intrinsic signals and voltagesensitive dyes, as well as measurements with oxygen-sensitive electrodes have elucidated the spatiotemporal relationship between neuronal activity, cerebral blood volume, and oximetry in vivo. A focal decrease in tissue oxygenation and a focal increase in deoxygenated hemoglobin occurs following both interictal and ictal events. This "epileptic dip" in oxygenation can persist for the duration of an ictal event, suggesting that cerebral blood flow is inadequate to meet metabolic demand. A rapid focal increase in cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume also accompanies epileptic events; however, this increase in perfusion soon ({\textgreater}2 s) spreads to a larger area of the cortex than the excitatory change in membrane potential. Investigations in humans during neurosurgical operations have confirmed the laboratory data derived from animal studies. These data not only have clinical implications for the interpretation of noninvasive imaging studies such as positron emission tomography, single-photon emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging but also provide a mechanism for the cognitive decline in patients with chronic epilepsy.},

In particular, spontaneous or resting state activity has been studied on various scales of spatial and temporal organization including those that relate to physiological, encephalographic and hemodynamic data. In this article we focus on the brain from the perspective of a dynamic network and discuss the role of its network constituents in shaping brain dynamics. These constituents include the brain's structural connectivity, the population dynamics of its network nodes and the time delays involved in signal transmission. In addition, no discussion of brain dynamics would be complete without considering noise and stochastic effects. In fact, there is mounting evidence that the interaction between noise and dynamics plays an important functional role in shaping key brain processes. In particular, we discuss a unifying theoretical framework that explains how structured spatio-temporal resting state patterns emerge from noise driven explorations of unstable or stable oscillatory states. Embracing this perspective, we explore the consequences of network manipulations to understand some of the brain's dysfunctions, as well as network effects that offer new insights into routes towards therapy, recovery and brain repair. These collective insights will be at the core of a new computational environment, the Virtual Brain, which will allow flexible incorporation of empirical data constraining the brain models to integrate, unify and predict network responses to incipient pathological processes.},

abstract = {Seizures can occur spontaneously and in a recurrent manner, which defines epilepsy; or they can be induced in a normal brain under a variety of conditions in most neuronal networks and species from flies to humans. Such universality raises the possibility that invariant properties exist that characterize seizures under different physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we analysed seizure dynamics mathematically and established a taxonomy of seizures based on first principles. For the predominant seizure class we developed a generic model called Epileptor. As an experimental model system, we used ictal-like discharges induced in vitro in mouse hippocampi. We show that only five state variables linked by integral-differential equations are sufficient to describe the onset, time course and offset of ictal-like discharges as well as their recurrence. Two state variables are responsible for generating rapid discharges (fast time scale), two for spike and wave events (intermediate time scale) and one for the control of time course, including the alternation between 'normal' and ictal periods (slow time scale). We propose that normal and ictal activities coexist: a separatrix acts as a barrier (or seizure threshold) between these states. Seizure onset is reached upon the collision of normal brain trajectories with the separatrix. We show theoretically and experimentally how a system can be pushed toward seizure under a wide variety of conditions. Within our experimental model, the onset and offset of ictal-like discharges are well-defined mathematical events: a saddle-node and homoclinic bifurcation, respectively. These bifurcations necessitate a baseline shift at onset and a logarithmic scaling of interspike intervals at offset. These predictions were not only confirmed in our in vitro experiments, but also for focal seizures recorded in different syndromes, brain regions and species (humans and zebrafish). Finally, we identified several possible biophysical parameters contributing to the five state variables in our model system. We show that these parameters apply to specific experimental conditions and propose that there exists a wide array of possible biophysical mechanisms for seizure genesis, while preserving central invariant properties. Epileptor and the seizure taxonomy will guide future modeling and translational research by identifying universal rules governing the initiation and termination of seizures and predicting the conditions necessary for those transitions.},

abstract = {See Lytton (doi:10.1093/awx018) for a scientific commentary on this article.Neural network oscillations are a fundamental mechanism for cognition, perception and consciousness. Consequently, perturbations of network activity play an important role in the pathophysiology of brain disorders. When structural information from non-invasive brain imaging is merged with mathematical modelling, then generative brain network models constitute personalized in silico platforms for the exploration of causal mechanisms of brain function and clinical hypothesis testing. We here demonstrate with the example of drug-resistant epilepsy that patient-specific virtual brain models derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging have sufficient predictive power to improve diagnosis and surgery outcome. In partial epilepsy, seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone, before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We create personalized large-scale brain networks for 15 patients and simulate the individual seizure propagation patterns. Model validation is performed against the presurgical stereotactic electroencephalography data and the standard-of-care clinical evaluation. We demonstrate that the individual brain models account for the patient seizure propagation patterns, explain the variability in postsurgical success, but do not reliably augment with the use of patient-specific connectivity. Our results show that connectome-based brain network models have the capacity to explain changes in the organization of brain activity as observed in some brain disorders, thus opening up avenues towards discovery of novel clinical interventions.},

abstract = {509 ICU = intensive care unit; SvO 2 = central venous oxygen saturation. Available online http://ccforum.com/content/6/6/509 Many statistical methods require assumptions to be made about the format of the data to be analysed. For example, the paired t-test introduced in Statistics review 5 requires that the distribu-tion of the differences be approximately Normal, while the unpaired t-test requires an assumption of Normality to hold sep-arately for both sets of observations. Fortunately, these assump-tions are often valid in clinical data, and where they are not true of the raw data it is often possible to apply a suitable transforma-tion. There are situations in which even transformed data may not satisfy the assumptions, however, and in these cases it may be inappropriate to use traditional (parametric) methods of analysis. (Methods such as the t-test are known as 'parametric' because they require estimation of the parameters that define the underlying distribution of the data; in the case of the t-test, for instance, these parameters are the mean and standard devi-ation that define the Normal distribution.) Nonparametric methods provide an alternative series of statis-tical methods that require no or very limited assumptions to be made about the data. There is a wide range of methods that can be used in different circumstances, but some of the more commonly used are the nonparametric alternatives to the t-tests, and it is these that are covered in the present review.},

Methods: This study included 19 patients who underwent intracranial electrode implantation in bilateral temporal lobes and had at least one seizure recorded at 1. kHz sampling rate. The characteristics of ictal HFO in the medial temporal lobe, and the relations between the presence of HFO, pathology, and postoperative seizure outcome were analyzed. Results: Ictal HFO were detected from medial temporal structures in 11 patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Among eight patients without HFO, only three were diagnosed with MTLE. Ictal HFO were detected from unilateral medial temporal structures ipsilateral to the side of hippocampal sclerosis (HS). In one patient with bitemporal independent seizure onset, ictal HFO were detected only on the side of HS. HS was detected in all 11 patients with HFO, but in only one of four patients without HFO. Seizure outcome did not differ between patients with and without HFO. Conclusions: Ictal HFO in the medial temporal lobe may be a specific marker for MTLE with HS.

Methods: We introduce a novel automated HFO detection method based on the amplitude and features of the HFO events. We examined intracranial recordings from 33 patients and compared HFO rates and characteristics between channels within and outside the seizure onset zone (SOZ). We analyzed changes of HFO activity from interictal to preictal and to ictal periods. Results: The average HFO rate is higher for SOZ channels compared to non-SOZ channels during all periods. Amplitudes and durations of HFO are higher for events within the SOZ in all periods compared to non-SOZ events, while their frequency is lower. All analyzed HFO features increase for the ictal period. Conclusions: HFO may occur in all channels but their rate is significantly higher within SOZ and HFO characteristics differ from HFO outside the SOZ, but the effect size of difference is small. Significance: The present results show that based on accumulated dataset it is possible to distinguish HFO features different for SOZ and non-SOZ channels, and to show changes in HFO characteristics during the transition from interictal to preictal and to ictal periods.},

Hz) in preresection electrocorticography (preECoG) in epilepsy patients seems a predictor of good surgical outcome. We analyzed occurrence and localization of HFOs in intra-operative preECoG and postresection electrocorticography (postECoG). Methods: HFOs were automatically detected in one-minute epochs of intra-operative ECoG sampled at 2048. Hz of fourteen patients. Ripple, fast ripple, spike, ripples on a spike (RoS) and not on a spike (RnoS) rates were analyzed in pre- and postECoG for resected and nonresected electrodes. Results: Ripple, spike and fast ripple rates decreased after resection. RnoS decreased less than RoS (74{\%} vs. 83{\%}; p= 0.01). Most fast ripples in preECoG were located in resected tissue. PostECoG fast ripples occurred in one patient with poor outcome. Patients with good outcome had relatively high postECoG RnoS rates, specifically in the sensorimotor cortex. Conclusions: Our observations show that fast ripples in intra-operative ECoG, compared to ripples, may be a better biomarker for epileptogenicity. Further studies have to determine the relation between resection of epileptogenic tissue and physiological ripples generated by the sensorimotor cortex. Significance: Fast ripples in intra-operative ECoG can help identify the epileptogenic zone, while ripples might also be physiological.},

abstract = {In this study, we propose and evaluate a technique known as common average referencing (CAR) to generate a more ideal reference electrode for microelectrode recordings. CAR is a computationally simple technique, and therefore amenable to both on-chip and real-time applications. CAR is commonly used in EEG, where it is necessary to identify small signal sources in very noisy recordings. To study the efficacy of common average referencing, we compared CAR to both referencing with a stainless steel bone-screw and a single microelectrode site. Data consisted of in vivo chronic recordings in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats drawn from prior studies, as well as previously unpublished data. By combining the data from multiple studies, we generated and analyzed one of the more comprehensive chronic neural recording datasets to date. Reference types were compared in terms of noise level, signal-to-noise ratio, and number of neurons recorded across days. Common average referencing was found to drastically outperform standard types of electrical referencing, reducing noise by {\textgreater}30{\%}. As a result of the reduced noise floor, arrays referenced to a CAR yielded almost 60{\%} more discernible neural units than traditional methods of electrical referencing. CAR should impart similar benefits to other microelectrode recording technologies-for example, chemical sensing-where similar differential recording concepts apply. In addition, we provide a mathematical justification for CAR using Gauss-Markov theorem and therefore help place the application of CAR into a theoretical context.},

abstract = {See Eissa and Schevon (doi:10.1093/aww332) for a scientific commentary on this article. Surgery can be a last resort for patients with intractable, medically refractory epilepsy. For many of these patients, however, there is substantial risk that the surgery will be ineffective. The prediction of who is likely to benefit from a surgical approach is crucial for being able to inform patients better, conduct principled prospective clinical trials, and ultimately tailor therapeutic approaches to these patients more effectively. Dynamical computational models, informed with patient data, can be used to make predictions and give mechanistic insight. In this study, we develop patient-specific dynamical network models of epileptogenic cortex. We infer the network connectivity matrix from non-seizure electrographic recordings of patients and use these connectivity matrices as the network structure in our model. The model simulates the dynamics of a bi-stable switch at every node in this network, meaning that every node starts in a background state, but has the ability to transit to a co-existing seizure state. Whether a transition happens in a node is partly determined by the stochastic nature of the input to the node, but also by the input the node receives from other connected nodes in the network. By conducting simulations with such a model, we can detect the average transition time for nodes in a given network, and therefore define nodes with a short transition time as highly epileptogenic. In a retrospective study, we found that in some patients the regions with high epileptogenicity in the model overlap with those identified clinically as the seizure onset zone. Moreover, it was found that the resection of these regions in the model reduces the overall likelihood of a seizure. Following removal of these regions in the model, we predicted surgical outcomes and compared these to actual patient outcomes. Our predictions were found to be 81.3{\%} accurate on a dataset of 16 patients with intractable epilepsy. Intriguingly, in patients with unsuccessful outcomes, the proposed computational approach is able to suggest alternative resection sites. The model presented here gives mechanistic insight as to why surgery may be unsuccessful in some patients. This may aid clinicians in presurgical evaluation by providing a tool to explore various surgical options, offering complementary information to existing clinical techniques.},

abstract = {Seizures are increasingly understood to arise from epileptogenic networks across which ictal activity is propagated and sustained. In patients undergoing invasive monitoring for epilepsy surgery, high frequency oscillations have been observed within the seizure onset zone during both ictal and interictal intervals. We hypothesized that the patterns by which high frequency activity is propagated would help elucidate epileptogenic networks and thereby identify network nodes relevant for surgical planning. Intracranial EEG recordings were analyzed with a multivariate autoregressive modeling technique (short-time direct directed transfer function-SdDTF), based on the concept of Granger causality, to estimate the directionality and intensity of propagation of high frequency activity (70-175. Hz) during ictal and interictal recordings. These analyses revealed prominent divergence and convergence of high frequency activity propagation at sites identified by epileptologists as part of the ictal onset zone. In contrast, relatively little propagation of this activity was observed among the other analyzed sites. This pattern was observed in both subdural and depth electrode recordings of patients with focal ictal onset, but not in patients with a widely distributed ictal onset. In patients with focal ictal onsets, the patterns of propagation recorded during pre-ictal (up to 5. min immediately preceding ictal onset) and interictal (more than 24. h before and after seizures) intervals were very similar to those recorded during seizures. The ability to characterize epileptogenic networks from interictal recordings could have important clinical implications for epilepsy surgery planning by reducing the need for prolonged invasive monitoring to record spontaneous seizures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Abnormally strong functional linkage between cortical areas has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of partial epilepsy. We explore the possibility that such linkages may be manifest in the interictal EEG apart from epileptiform disturbances or visually evident focal abnormalities. We analyzed samples of interictal intracranial EEG (ICEEG) recorded from subdural grids in nine patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy, measuring interelectrode synchrony using the mean phase coherence algorithm. This analysis revealed areas of elevated local synchrony, or "hypersynchrony" which had persistent spatiotemporal characteristics that were unique to each patient. Measuring local synchrony in a subdural grid results in a map of the cortical surface that provides information not visually apparent on either EEG or structural imaging. We explore the relationship of hypersynchronous areas to the clinical evidence of seizure localization in each case, and speculate that local hypersynchrony may be a marker of epileptogenic cortex, and may prove to be a valuable aid to clinical ICEEG interpretation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Epileptic seizures are commonly characterized as 'hypersynchronous states'. This habit is doubly misleading, because seizures are not necessarily synchronous and are not unchanging 'states' but dynamic processes. Here the temporal evolution of the correlation structure in the course of 100 focal onset seizures of 60 patients recorded by intracranial multichannel EEG was assessed. To this end a multivariate method was applied that at its core consists of computing the eigenvalue spectrum of the zero-lag correlation matrix of a short sliding window. Our results show that there are clearly observable and statistically significant changes of the correlation structure of focal onset seizures. Specifically, these changes indicate that the zero-lag correlation of multi-channel EEG either remains approximately unchanged or-especially in the case of secondary generalization-decreases during the first half of the seizures. Then correlation gradually increases again before the seizures terminate. This development was qualitatively independent of the anatomical location of the seizure onset zone and therefore seems to be a generic property of focal onset seizures. We suggest that the decorrelation of EEG activity is due to the different propagation times of locally synchronous ictal discharges from the seizure onset zone to other brain areas. Furthermore we speculate that the increase of correlation during the second half of the seizures may be causally related to seizure termination.},

In contrast, higher-frequency oscillations (250-500 Hz), termed fast ripples (FR), have been described in seizure-generating limbic areas of rodents made epileptic by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and observed in humans ipsilateral to areas of seizure initiation. However, quantitative studies supporting the existence of two spectrally distinct oscillatory events have not been carried out in humans nor has the preferential appearance of FR within seizure generating areas received statistical evaluation based on analysis of a large sample of oscillatory events. Interictal oscillations within the bandwidth of 80-500 Hz were detected in Hip and EC areas of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy using wideband EEG recorded during non-rapid eye-movement sleep from chronically implanted depth electrodes. Power spectral analysis showed that oscillations detected from Hip and EC areas were composed of two spectrally distinct groups. The lower-frequency ripple group was defined by a frequency of 96 +/- 14 Hz (median +/- width), while the higher-frequency FR group had a frequency of 262 +/- 59 Hz. FR oscillations were significantly shorter in duration compared with ripple oscillations (P {\textless} 0.0001). In regard to the occurrence of FR and ripples in epileptic Hip and EC, the mean ratio of the number of FR to ripples generated in areas ipsilateral to seizure onset was significantly higher compared with the mean ratio of FR to ripple generation from contralateral areas (P = 0.008). Furthermore, sites ipsilateral to seizure onset with hippocampal atrophy had significantly higher ratios compared with sites contralateral to both seizure onset and hippocampal atrophy (P = 0.001). These data provide compelling quantitative and statistical evidence for the existence of two spectrally distinct groups of limbic oscillations that have frequency and duration characteristics similar to those previously described in epileptic rat and human Hip and EC. The strong association between FR and regions of seizure initiation supports the view that FR reflects pathological hypersynchronous events crucially associated with seizure genesis.},

abstract = {Objective High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) are being studied as a biomarker of epilepsy, yet it is unknown how various acquisition parameters at different centers affect detection and analysis of HFOs. This paper specifically quantifies effects of sampling rate (FS) and anti-aliasing filter (AAF) positions on automated HFO detection. Methods HFOs were detected on intracranial EEG recordings (17 patients) with 5 kHz FS. HFO detection was repeated on downsampled and/or filtered copies of the EEG data, mimicking sampling rates and low-pass filter settings of various acquisition equipment. For each setting, we compared the HFO detection sensitivity, HFO features, and ability to identify the ictal onset zone. Results The relative sensitivity remained above 80{\%} for either FS ⩾2 kHz or AAF ⩾500 Hz. HFO feature distributions were consistent (AUROC {\textless} 0.7) down to 1 kHz FS or 200 Hz AAF. HFO rate successfully identified ictal onset zone over most settings. HFO peak frequency was highly variable under most parameters (Spearman correlation {\textless} 0.5). Conclusions We recommend at least FS ⩾2 kHz and AAF ⩾500 Hz to detect HFOs. Additionally, HFO peak frequency is not robust at any setting: the same HFO event can be variably classified either as a ripple ({\textless}200 Hz) or fast ripple ({\textgreater}250 Hz) under different acquisition settings. Significance These results inform clinical centers on requirements to analyze HFO rates and features.},

abstract = {Objective: Interictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG are a potential biomarker of epilepsy, but current automated HFO detectors require human review to remove artifacts. Our objective is to automatically redact false HFO detections, facilitating clinical use of interictal HFOs. Methods: Intracranial EEG data from 23 patients were processed with automated detectors of HFOs and artifacts. HFOs not concurrent with artifacts were labeled quality HFOs (qHFOs). Methods were validated by human review on a subset of 2000 events. The correlation of qHFO rates with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) was assessed via (1) a retrospective asymmetry measure and (2) a novel quasi-prospective algorithm to identify SOZ. Results: Human review estimated that less than 12{\%} of qHFOs are artifacts, whereas 78.5{\%} of redacted HFOs are artifacts. The qHFO rate was more correlated with SOZ (p = 0.020, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and resected volume (p = 0.0037) than baseline detections. Using qHFOs, our algorithm was able to determine SOZ in 60{\%} of the ILAE Class I patients, with all algorithmically-determined SOZs fully within the resected volumes. Conclusions: The algorithm reduced false-positive HFO detections, improving the precision of the HFO-biomarker. Significance: These methods provide a feasible strategy for HFO detection in real-time, continuous EEG with minimal human monitoring of data quality.},

abstract = {Graph theory provides many metrics of complex network organization that can be applied to analysis of brain networks derived from neuroimaging data. Here we investigated the test-retest reliability of graph metrics of functional networks derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded in two sessions from 16 healthy volunteers who were studied at rest and during performance of the n-back working memory task in each session. For each subject's data at each session, we used a wavelet filter to estimate the mutual information (MI) between each pair of MEG sensors in each of the classical frequency intervals from ?? to low ?? in the overall range 1-60??Hz. Undirected binary graphs were generated by thresholding the MI matrix and 8 global network metrics were estimated: the clustering coefficient, path length, small-worldness, efficiency, cost-efficiency, assortativity, hierarchy, and synchronizability. Reliability of each graph metric was assessed using the intraclass correlation (ICC). Good reliability was demonstrated for most metrics applied to the n-back data (mean ICC = 0.62). Reliability was greater for metrics in lower frequency networks. Higher frequency ??- and ??-band networks were less reliable at a global level but demonstrated high reliability of nodal metrics in frontal and parietal regions. Performance of the n-back task was associated with greater reliability than measurements on resting state data. Task practice was also associated with greater reliability. Collectively these results suggest that graph metrics are sufficiently reliable to be considered for future longitudinal studies of functional brain network changes. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and fMRI experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

abstract = {Purpose The study aimed to assess whether engagement in a memory training programme and performing internet brain training exercises improve memory function in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods Seventy-seven people with TLE, complaining of memory difficulties, completed the study. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 67 years and 40 had left TLE. Participants were randomised to one of four conditions; Group 1: traditional memory training, Group 2: Lumosity, an on-line cognitive training programme, Group 3: traditional memory training and Lumosity, and Group 4: no training. Memory efficiency and mood were assessed at baseline and three months later. Results Group analyses indicated improved verbal recall after training (p {\textless} 0.001) and improved subjective ratings (p {\textless} 0.007). More participants reported a lessening of the memory burden (p {\textless} 0.007) after training; differences were significant between Groups 1 and 3 compared to Group 4. Lumosity use was not associated with changes in the memory outcome measures but there was a relationship with depression ratings and the number of memory games played (p {\textless} 0.01). Conventional memory training, IQ, and post-surgical status were associated with positive memory outcomes. Conclusions The study indicates traditional memory rehabilitation techniques can help reduce the burden of memory impairment in TLE. There was no evidence that Lumosity the on-line cognitive training programme had specific advantages. Positive change was not universal and larger studies will be required to explore factors associated with successful outcomes.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Objective: In one third of patients with a diagnosis of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy who are candidates for therapeutic surgery, cerebral areas responsible for seizure gen-eration can be defined exclusively with invasive intracranial recordings. A correct pre-surgical identification of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) with intracranial electrodes has a direct impact on postsurgical outcome. We aimed at identifying biomarkers of the EZ based on computer-assisted inspection of intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Computer-driven intracranial EEG analysis in the domains of time, fre-quency, and space was retrospectively applied to a population of 10 patients with focal epilepsy to detect EZ electrophysiologic markers. Next, a prospective study was per-formed on 14 surgery candidate patients. The stereo-EEG computer-assisted analysis of EZ boundaries performed blind from patients data was compared to that defined with the traditional visual inspection completed by neurophysiologists. Results: In the retrospective study, the EZ was characterized by the combined detec-tion of three biomarkers observed at seizure onset: (1) fast activity at 80–120 Hz asso-ciated with (2) very slow transient polarizing shift and (3) voltage depression (flattening). Correlations between these indexes were calculated for each seizure. In the prospective study, the quantified analysis based on the three biomarkers con-firmed a complete overlap between leads within the EZ identified by expert clinicians. In 2 of 14 patients the proposed biomarkers partially identified the EZ. Significance: Our findings demonstrate and validate with a prospective unbiased study the use of three neurophysiologic intracranial EEG parameters as excellent biomar-kers of ictogenesis and as reliable indicators of EZ boundaries.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Invasive ictal EEG recording is often necessary to delineate epileptogenic areas in patients with intractable partial epilepsy, but even intracranial ictal recordings often reveal ill-defined onset zones in neocortical epilepsy. We studied the physiologic significance of ictal direct current (DC) potentials recorded intracranially in human epilepsy. METHODS: We made intracranial ictal EEG recordings in three patients with intractable partial seizures arising from frontal, lateral temporal, and parietal neocortical areas by using closely spaced subdural electrodes (platinum in two patients and stainless steel in one patient) with both standard (1.5 Hz) and open (0.016 Hz) low-frequency filter (LFF) settings. RESULTS: The initial ictal pattern was localized to two to nine subdural electrodes and characterized by very low voltage and high-frequency rhythmic activity ("electrodecremental pattern"). A slow-rising negative potential (DC potential) was seen in a slightly more restricted area (two to six electrodes) and occurred 1-10 s before the initial ictal EEG discharges in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results agree with those of previous studies of ictal DC shifts in animals and suggest that ictal DC shifts may be helpful in delineating the epileptogenic area more precisely in human epilepsy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Ripples (80-150 Hz) recorded from clinical macroelectrodes have been shown to be an accurate biomarker of epileptogenic brain tissue. We investigated coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude to better understand the mechanisms that generate this type of pathologic ripple (pRipple) event. METHODS We quantified phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) spike phase and ripple amplitude recorded from intracranial depth macroelectrodes during episodes of sleep in 12 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. PAC was determined by (1) a phasor transform that corresponds to the strength and rate of ripples coupled with spikes, and a (2) ripple-triggered average to measure the strength, morphology, and spectral frequency of the modulating and modulated signals. Coupling strength was evaluated in relation to recording sites within and outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). RESULTS Both the phasor transform and ripple-triggered averaging methods showed that ripple amplitude was often robustly coupled with epileptiform EEG spike phase. Coupling was found more regularly inside than outside the SOZ, and coupling strength correlated with the likelihood a macroelectrode's location was within the SOZ (p {\textless} 0.01). The ratio of the rate of ripples coupled with EEG spikes inside the SOZ to rates of coupled ripples in non-SOZ was greater than the ratio of rates of ripples on spikes detected irrespective of coupling (p {\textless} 0.05). Coupling strength correlated with an increase in mean normalized ripple amplitude (p {\textless} 0.01), and a decrease in mean ripple spectral frequency (p {\textless} 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE Generation of low-frequency (80-150 Hz) pRipples in the SOZ involves coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude. The changes in excitability reflected as epileptiform spikes may also cause clusters of pathologically interconnected bursting neurons to grow and synchronize into aberrantly large neuronal assemblies.},

abstract = {The discovery that electroencephalography (EEG) contains useful information at frequencies above the traditional 80Hz limit has had a profound impact on our understanding of brain function. In epilepsy, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, {\textgreater}80Hz) have proven particularly important and useful. This literature review describes the morphology, clinical meaning, and pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs. To record HFOs, the intracranial EEG needs to be sampled at least at 2,000Hz. The oscillatory events can be visualized by applying a high-pass filter and increasing the time and amplitude scales, or EEG time-frequency maps can show the amount of high-frequency activity. HFOs appear excellent markers for the epileptogenic zone. In patients with focal epilepsy who can benefit from surgery, invasive EEG is often required to identify the epileptic cortex, but current information is sometimes inadequate. Removal of brain tissue generating HFOs has been related to better postsurgical outcome than removing the seizure onset zone, indicating that HFOs may mark cortex that needs to be removed to achieve seizure control. The pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs is challenging, probably involving populations of neurons firing asynchronously. They differ from physiological HFOs in not being paced by rhythmic inhibitory activity and in their possible origin from population spikes. Their link to the epileptogenic zone argues that their study will teach us much about the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. HFOs show promise for improving surgical outcome and accelerating intracranial EEG investigations. Their potential needs to be assessed by future research.},

abstract = {Unique high-frequency oscillations of 250 to 500 Hz, termed fast ripples, have been identified in seizure-generating limbic areas in rats made epileptic by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid, and in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In the rat, fast ripples clearly are generated by a different neuronal population than normally occurring endogenous ripple oscillations (100-200 Hz), but this distinction has not been previously evaluated in humans. The characteristics of oscillations in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands were compared in the entorhinal cortex of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy using local field potential and unit recordings from chronically implanted bundles of eight microelectrodes with tips spaced 500 microm apart. The results showed that ripple oscillations possessed different voltage versus depth profiles compared with fast ripple oscillations. Fast ripple oscillations usually demonstrated a reversal of polarity in the middle layers of entorhinal cortex, whereas ripple oscillations rarely showed reversals across entorhinal cortex layers. There was no significant difference in the amplitude distributions of ripple and fast ripple oscillations. Furthermore, multiunit synchronization was significantly increased during fast ripple oscillations compared with ripple oscillations (p {\textless} 0.001). These data recorded from the mesial temporal lobe of epileptic patients suggest that the cellular networks underlying fast ripple generation are more localized than those involved in the generation of normally occurring ripple oscillations. Results from this study are consistent with previous studies in the intrahippocampal kainic acid rat model of chronic epilepsy that provide evidence supporting the view that fast ripples in the human brain reflect localized pathological events related to epileptogenesis.},

abstract = {Cortical dysplastic lesions (CDyLs) are often associated with severe partial epilepsies. We describe the electrographic counterpart of this high degree of epileptogenicity, manifested by continuous or frequent rhythmic epileptogenic discharges recorded directly from CDyLs during intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG). These ictal or continuous epileptogenic discharges (I/CEDs) assumed one of the following three patterns: (1) repetitive electrographic seizures, (2) repetitive bursting discharges, or (3) continuous or quasicontinuous rhythmic spiking. One or more of these patterns were present in 23 of 34 patients (67{\%}) with intractable partial epilepsy associated with CDyLs, and in only 1 of 40 patients (2.5{\%}) with intractable partial epilepsy associated with other types of structural lesions. I/CEDs were usually spatially restricted, thus contrasting with the more widespread interictal ECoG epileptic activity, and tended to colocalize with the magnetic resonance imaging-defined lesion. Completeness of excision of cortical tissue displaying I/CEDs correlated positively with surgical outcome in patients with medically intractable seizures; i.e., three-fourths of the patients in whom it was entirely excised had favorable surgical outcome; in contrast, uniformly poor outcome was observed in those patients in whom areas containing I/CEDs remained in situ. We conclude that CDyLs are highly and intrinsically epileptogenic, and that intraoperative ECoG identification of this intrinsically epileptogenic dysplastic cortical tissue is crucial to decide the extent of excision for best seizure control.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by recurring seizures. In 30{\%} of patients, seizures are insufficiently reduced by anti-epileptic drugs. In the case where seizures originate from a relatively circumscribed region of the brain, epilepsy is said to be partial and surgery can be indicated. The success of epilepsy surgery depends on the accurate localization and delineation of the epileptogenic zone (which often involves several structures), responsible for seizures. It requires a comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation of patients that includes not only imaging data but also long-term monitoring of electrophysiological signals (scalp and intracerebral EEG). During the past decades, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of signal analysis techniques aimed at characterizing the functional connectivity among spatially distributed regions over interictal (outside seizures) or ictal (during seizures) periods from EEG data. Most of these methods rely on the measurement of statistical couplings among signals recorded from distinct brain sites. However, methods differ with respect to underlying theoretical principles (mostly coming from the field of statistics or the field of non-linear physics). The objectives of this paper are: (i) to provide an brief overview of methods aimed at characterizing functional brain connectivity from electrophysiological data, (ii) to provide concrete application examples in the context of drug-refractory partial epilepsies, and iii) to highlight some key points emerging from results obtained both on real intracerebral EEG signals and on signals simulated from physiologically plausible models in which the underlying connectivity patterns are known a priori (ground truth).},

abstract = {One of the challenges in modeling cognitive events from electroencephalogram (EEG) data is finding representations that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences, as well as to inherent noise associated with such data. Herein, we propose a novel approach for learning such representations from multi-channel EEG time-series, and demonstrate its advantages in the context of mental load classification task. First, we transform EEG activities into a sequence of topology-preserving multi-spectral images, as opposed to standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such spatial information. Next, we train a deep recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art video classification to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. The proposed approach is designed to preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal structure of EEG which leads to finding features that are less sensitive to variations and distortions within each dimension. Empirical evaluation on the cognitive load classification task demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy over current state-of-the-art approaches in this field.},

In each case, we describe the neural network architectures and training rules and provide a statistical commentary. The topics treated in this way are perceptrons (from single-unit to multilayer versions), Hopfield-type recurrent networks (including probabilistic versions strongly related to statistical physics and Gibbs distributions) and associative memory networks trained by so-called unsuperviszd learning rules.

abstract = {Synaptic reorganization of mossy fibers following kainic acid (KA) administration has been reported to contribute to the formation of recurrent excitatory circuits, resulting in an epileptogenic state. It is unclear, however, whether KA-induced mossy fiber sprouting results from neuronal cell loss or the seizure activity that KA induces. We have recently demonstrated that certain strains of mice are resistant to excitotoxic cell death, yet exhibit seizure activity similar to what has been observed in rodents susceptible to KA. The present study takes advantage of these strain differences to explore the roles of seizure activity vs cell loss in triggering mossy fiber sprouting. In order to understand the relationships between gene induction, cell death, and the sprouting response, we assessed the regulation of two molecules associated with the sprouting response, c-fos and GAP-43, in mice resistant (C57BL/6) and susceptible (FVB/N) to KA-induced cell death. Following administration of KA, increases in c-fos immunoreactivity were observed in both strains, although prolonged induction of c-fos was present only in the hippocampal neurons of FVB/N mice. Mossy fiber sprouting following KA administration was also only observed in FVB/N mice, while induction of GAP-43, a marker associated with mossy fiber sprouting, was not observed in either strain. These results indicate that: (i) KA-induced seizure activity alone is insufficient to induce mossy fiber sprouting; (ii) mossy fiber sprouting may be due to the loss of hilar neurons following kainate administration; and (iii) induction of GAP-43 is not a necessary component of the sprouting response that occurs following KA in mice.},

abstract = {Patients and models of temporal lobe epilepsy have fewer inhibitory interneurons in the dentate gyrus than controls, but it is unclear whether granule cell inhibition is reduced. We report the loss of GABAergic inhibition of granule cells in the temporal dentate gyrus of pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats. In situ hybridization for GAD65 mRNA and immunocytochemistry for parvalbumin and somatostatin confirmed the loss of inhibitory interneurons. In epileptic rats, granule cells had prolonged EPSPs, and they discharged more action potentials than controls. Although the conductances of evoked IPSPs recorded in normal ACSF were not significantly reduced and paired-pulse responses showed enhanced inhibition of granule cells from epileptic rats, more direct measures of granule cell inhibition revealed significant deficiencies. In granule cells from epileptic rats, evoked monosynaptic IPSP conductances were {\textless}40{\%} of controls, and the frequency of GABA(A) receptor-mediated spontaneous and miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) was {\textless}50{\%} of controls. Within 3-7 d after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, miniature IPSC frequency had decreased, and it remained low, without functional evidence of compensatory synaptogenesis by GABAergic axons in chronically epileptic rats. Both parvalbumin- and somatostatin-immunoreactive interneuron numbers and the frequency of both fast- and slow-rising GABA(A) receptor-mediated mIPSCs were reduced, suggesting that loss of inhibitory synaptic input to granule cells occurred at both proximal/somatic and distal/dendritic sites. Reduced granule cell inhibition in the temporal dentate gyrus preceded the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures by days to weeks, so it may contribute, but is insufficient, to cause epilepsy.},

abstract = {Damage to the brain triggers a host of reactive responses in neurons and glia which are seen at sites of focal injury as well as at sites that are at a distance from the injury. Although many of these responses have been studied extensively, the signals that initiate the different responses have not been fully characterized, and it is still not understood how focal injury affects neurons and glia in distant sites. The present review summarizes recent findings that suggest that physiological events that occur at the time of the injury or during the early postlesion period can play an important and variable role in modulating neuronal and glial responses to injury. We focus on the events that occur in the hippocampal formation following unilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex - a model system that has been used extensively for studies of cellular responses following focal brain injury. This lesion destroys the cells of origin of a massive excitatory projection to the dentate gyrus and hippocampus proper. Over time, the denervated neurons in the hippocampal formation are almost completely reinnervated as a result of local sprouting of systems that survive the lesion. Thus, this model system has been useful for studying cellular responses to both denervation and reinnervation. We summarize the information that this injury triggers physiological events that can strongly modulate gene expression in neurons and glia, including episodes of spreading depression that occur at the time of the injury, seizures that occur during the early postlesion period, the loss of afferent drive which leads to decreases in postsynaptic activity, and the restoration of activity that occurs in conjunction with reinnervation. We describe recent studies which suggest that some of these physiological events occur to a variable extent in different animals, especially the episodes of spreading depression and the recurrent seizures. Thus, the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of altered gene expression following this "model" experimental injury may vary from animal to animal. The fact that physiological events strongly modulate the reactive changes in gene expression that occur following injury has important implications for understanding the sequelae of injury, and offers new opportunities for experimental and therapeutic interventions that may improve cellular repair, regeneration, and recovery of function.},

One week after the delivery of a single, moderate (2.0-2.2 atm) mechanical pressure wave to the neocortex, the feed-forward inhibitory control of dentate granule cell discharges was compromised, and the frequency of miniature IPSCs was decreased. Consistent with the electrophysiological data, the number of hilar parvalbumin (PV)- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive dentate interneurons supplying the inhibitory innervation of the perisomatic region of granule cells was decreased weeks and months after head injury. The initial injury to the hilar neurons took place instantaneously after the impact and did not require the recruitment of active physiological processes. Furthermore, the decrease in the number of PV- and CCK-positive hilar interneurons was similar to the decrease in the number of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit 2/3-immunoreactive mossy cells, indicating that the pressure wave-transient causes injurious physical stretching and bending of most cells that are large and not tightly packed in a cell layer. These results reveal for the first time that moderate pressure wave-transients, triggered by traumatic head injury episodes, impact the dentate neuronal network in a unique temporal and spatial pattern, resulting in a net decrease in the perisomatic control of granule cell discharges.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stereotactic laser ablation offers an advantage over open surgical procedures for treatment of epileptic foci, tumors, and other brain pathology. Robot-assisted stereotactic laser ablation could offer an accurate, efficient, minimally invasive, and safe method for placement of an ablation catheter into the target. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of placement of a stereotactic laser ablation catheter into a brain lesion with the use of robotic assistance, via a safe, accurate, efficient, and minimally invasive manner. METHODS: A laser ablation catheter (Visualase, Inc) was placed by using robotic guidance (ROSA, Medtech Surgical, Inc) under general anesthesia into a localized epileptogenic periventricular heterotopic lesion in a 19-year-old woman with 10-year refractory focal seizure history. The laser applicator (1.65 mm diameter) position was confirmed by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ablation using the Visualase system was performed under multiplanar imaging with real-time thermal imaging and treatment estimates in each plane. A postablation MRI sequence (T1 postgadolinium contrast injection) was used to immediately confirm the ablation. RESULTS: MRI showed accurate skin entry point and trajectory, with the applicator advanced to the lesion's distal boundary. Ablation was accomplished in less than 3 minutes of heating. The overall procedure, from time of skin incision to end of last ablation, was approximately 90 minutes. After confirmation of proper lesioning by using a T1 contrast-enhanced MRI, the applicator was removed, and the incision was closed using a single stitch. No hemorrhage or other untoward complication was visualized. The patient awoke without any complication, was observed overnight after admitting to a regular floor bed, and was discharged to home the following day. CONCLUSION: This technique, using a combination of Visualase laser ablation, ROSA robot, and intraoperative MRI, facilitated a safe, efficacious, efficient, and minimally invasive approach that could be used for placement of 1 or multiple electrodes in the future.

abstract = {Objective To report the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of an exploratory study of MR-guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (MRgLITT) as a minimally invasive surgical procedure for the ablation of epileptogenic foci in children with drug-resistant, lesional epilepsy. Methods Retrospective chart review of all MRgLITT procedures at a single tertiary care center. All procedures were performed using a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared surgical laser ablation system (Visualase Thermal Therapy System). Predefined clinical and surgical variables were extracted from archived medical records. Results Seventeen patients underwent 19 MRgLITT procedures from May 2011 to January 2014. Mean age at seizure onset was 7.1 years (range 0.1–14.8 years). Mean age at surgery was 15.3 years (range 5.9–20.6 years). Surgical substrates were mixed but mainly composed of focal cortical dysplasia (n = 11). Complications occurred in four patients. Average length of hospitalization postsurgery was 1.56 days. Mean follow-up was 16.1 months (n = 16; range 3.5–35.9 months). Engel class I outcome was achieved in seven patients (7/17; 41{\%}), Engel class II in one (1/17; 6{\%}), Engel class III in three (3/17; 18{\%}), and Engel class IV in six (6/17; 35{\%}). Three patients (3/8; 38{\%}) with class I and II outcomes and five patients (5/9; 56{\%}) with class III and IV outcomes had at least one prior resection. Fisher's exact test was not statistically significant for the association between Engel class outcome and previous resection (p = 0.64). Significance This study provides descriptive results regarding the use of MRgLITT in a mixed population of pediatric, lesional, drug-resistant epilepsy cases. The ability to classify case-specific outcomes and reduce technical complications is anticipated as experience develops. Further multicenter, prospective studies are required to delineate optimal candidates for MRgLITT, and larger cohorts are needed to more accurately define outcome and complication rates.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Minimally invasive stereotactic tumor ablation is a viable option for the treatment of benign and malignant intracranial lesions. Although surgical excision constitutes first-line therapy for various brain pathologies, it can cause irreversible neurologic deficits. Additionally, many patients who may benefit from surgery do not qualify as surgical candidates due to multiple comorbidities. Recent advancements in laser interstitial thermal therapy, namely the ability to monitor ablation in real-time under MR imaging, have improved the safety and efficacy of the procedure. MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy is currently used as a minimally invasive treatment for brain metastases, radiation necrosis, glioma, and epilepsy. This article will discuss the principles, suggested indications, complications, and imaging characteristics of MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy as they pertain to the treatment of brain pathology.},

abstract = {PURPOSE In order to presurgically define the anatomical location of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and its proximity to possible cortical and subcortical eloquent areas in pediatric patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy, an array of noninvasive tools are available: recorded seizure semiology, scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings (ictal and interictal epileptic patterns), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), neuropsychological testing, and/or magnetoencephalography. When the noninvasive tools fail or are insufficient in precisely localizing the EZ and its functional and anatomical interphase with potential eloquent cortical areas, invasive extra-operative monitoring procedures might be needed. DISCUSSION In this chapter, we will discuss the main goals of extra-operative invasive evaluation for children with medically intractable epilepsy in whom cortical dysplasia is a possible etiology. We will specifically discuss the possible indications, surgical strategies, results, and morbidity associated with the placement of subdural and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. The rationale behind the choice of each one of the above techniques will also be discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Despite its long-reported successful record, with almost 60 years of clinical use, the technical complexity regarding the placement of stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) depth electrodes may have contributed to the limited widespread application of the technique in centers outside Europe. The authors report on a simplified and novel SEEG surgical technique in the extraoperative mapping of refractory focal epilepsy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The proposed technique was applied in patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy. Data regarding general demographic information, method of electrode implantation, time of implantation, number of implanted electrodes, seizure outcome after SEEG-guided resections, and complications were prospectively collected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: From March 2009 to April 2012, 122 patients underwent SEEG depth electrode implantation at the Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center in which the authors' technique was used. There were 65 male and 57 female patients whose mean age was 33 years (range 5-68 years). The group included 21 pediatric patients (younger than 18 years). Planning and implantations were performed in a single stage. The time for planning was, on average, 33 minutes (range 20-47 minutes), and the time for implantation was, on average, 107 minutes (range 47-150 minutes). Complications related to the SEEG technique were observed in 3 patients. The calculated risk of complications per electrode was 0.18{\%}. The seizure-free rate after SEEG-guided resections was 62{\%} in a mean follow-up period of 12 months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The authors report on a safe, simplified, and less time-consuming method of SEEG depth electrode implantation, using standard and widely available surgical tools, making the technique a reasonable option for extraoperative monitoring of patients with medically intractable epilepsy in centers lacking the Talairach stereotactic armamentarium.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) has been shown to be a valuable tool for preoperative decision making in focal epilepsy, there are few reports addressing the utility and safety of SEEG methodology applied to children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE To present the results of our early experience using SEEG in pediatric patients with difficult-to-localize epilepsy who were not considered candidates for subdural grid evaluation. METHODS Thirty children and adolescents with the diagnosis of medically refractory focal epilepsy (not considered ideal candidates for subdural grids and strip placement) underwent SEEG implantation. Demographics, electrophysiological localization of the hypothetical epileptogenic zone, complications, and seizure outcome after resections were analyzed. RESULTS Eighteen patients (60{\%}) underwent resections after SEEG implantations. In patients who did not undergo resections (12 patients), reasons included failure to localize the epileptogenic zone (4 patients); multifocal epileptogenic zone (4 patients); epileptogenic zone located in eloquent cortex, preventing resection (3 patients); and improvement in seizures after the implantation (1 patient). In patients who subsequently underwent resections, 10 patients (55.5{\%}) were seizure free (Engel class I) and 5 patients (27.7{\%}) experienced seizure improvement (Engel class II or III) at the end of the follow-up period (mean, 25.9 months; range, 12 to 47 months). The complication rate in SEEG implantations was 3{\%}. CONCLUSION The SEEG methodology is safe and should be considered in children/adolescents with difficult-to-localize epilepsy. When applied to highly complex and difficult-to-localize pediatric patients, SEEG may provide an additional opportunity for seizure freedom in association with a low morbidity rate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES There is controversy regarding the need for invasive monitoring in the preoperative assessment of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The use of a series of non-invasive investigations in identifying the seizure focus is reported in 75 consecutive adults referred for epilepsy surgery. METHODS All had video-EEG monitoring using scalp electrodes, high resolution MRI, and neuropsychology assessment. Other investigations included volumetric MRI, PET, and ictal and interictal SPECT. The seizure focus was localised and surgery offered if MRI disclosed unilateral hippocampal atrophy or a foreign tissue lesion and other investigations were either concordant or not discordant. RESULTS In 68 patients the seizure focus was localised and three patients were inoperable. Sixty five patients have been offered surgery and 50 have undergone temporal lobe surgery and have a follow up of at least 12 months (mean 24 months). All had pathology: hippocampal sclerosis 34, dysembryoblastic neuroepithelial tumour six, cavernoma four, dysplasia two, low grade glioma two, ganglioglioma two. Thirty nine patients (78{\%}) are seizure free postoperatively, 29/34 with hippocampal sclerosis and 10/16 with a foreign tissue lesion. Of the 11 patients with postoperative recurrent seizures, eight have a {\textgreater}90{\%} reduction in seizure frequency and three have {\textless}90{\%} reduction in seizure frequency but a worthwhile improvement.

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most specific method to define epileptogenic cortex. Its sensitivity and specificity depend on several factors such as age and recording procedures, for example, sleep recordings and activation procedures (hyperventilation, photic stimulation). EEG reveals characteristic findings in several epilepsy syndromes. Rarely, epileptiform discharges are recorded in healthy, particularly young individuals. Ictal video/EEG recording is considered to be critical in localizing the epileptogenic zone. A careful analysis of the first clinical signs and symptoms of a seizure and of the evolution of the seizure symptomatology can provide important localizing clues. Although surface EEG recordings are less sensitive than invasive studies, they provide the best overview and, therefore, the most efficient way to define the approximate localization of the epileptogenic zone. Invasive recordings are used in patients in whom the epileptogenic zone either cannot be located with noninvasive diagnostic methods or is adjacent to eloquent cortex. The most commonly used invasive electrodes are stereotactically implanted depth electrodes and subdural strip or grid electrodes. Foramen ovale and epidural electrodes are of intermediate invasiveness, but less sensitive. Invasive electrodes are subject to sampling errors if misplaced and should be used only after exhaustive noninvasive evaluations have (1) failed to localize the epileptogenic zone and (2) led to a testable hypothesis regarding this localization. Invasive EEG studies are associated with additional risks that are justifiable only if there is a good chance of obtaining essential localizing information and on a potentially resectable area. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the attempt to understand the processes affecting human focal epilepsy, various models that have been proposed as a back drop to which current observations of the clinical manifestations and therapies in this disorder can be tested. There are three main models that are reviewed. The notion of epileptogenicity as described by Penfield and Jasper's epileptogenic zone model postulates that specific regions of cerebral cortex have varying degrees of importance in the generation of focal epilepsy. A variation of this hypothesis comprises the second model put forth by Talairach and Bancaud. In this view the notion of the epileptogenic zone is expanded to incorporate a larger regions of cerebral cortex involved in the seizure propagation. A third concept and more separate hypothesis suggests that all components of the neural network involved in focal epilepsy are equally importance in the initiation and maintenance of the seizure. The various concepts underlying these models are reviewed in this paper and data from clinical and neurophysiologic observations are discussed in the context of these models. We suggest in this paper that the data best supports the epileptogenic zone hypothesis put forth by Penfield and Jasper.},

Results show that 55{\%} of patients are practically cured of their seizures and that 76{\%} benefited from cortectomy (reduction of more than 75{\%} of seizures). These results are the worst in the total series of St. Anne. Reasons for success and especially failure were analyzed in detail: 1. SEEG methods gave good indications along three dimensions of the limits and borders of the cortical excision. 2. When clinical semiology and organization of ictal discharges give evidence for rapid bilateral discharge, with involvement of axial musculature and generalized tonic-clonic manifestations, experience shows that it is necessary to combine cortectomy with a section of the adjacent cortico-subcortical fibers of the corona radiata, as if propagation of ictal discharges were impeded if not interrupted by sectioning such fibers and the primary site were incapable of expressing itself clinically. 3. If the characteristics of seizures suggest the quasisimultaneous involvement of the two frontal lobes and the existence of bilateral multifocal epilepsy, we suggest that a systematized anterior callosotomy might lead to useful results. 4. Finally, we propose general criteria for indications and contraindications for surgery.},

abstract = {Therapeutic devices provide new options for treating drug-resistant epilepsy. These devices act by a variety of mechanisms to modulate neuronal activity. Only vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which continues to develop new technology, is approved for use in the United States. Deep brain stimulation of anterior thalamus for partial epilepsy recently was approved in Europe and several other countries. Responsive neurostimulation, which delivers stimuli to 1 or 2 seizure foci in response to a detected seizure, recently completed a successful multicenter trial. Several other trials of brain stimulation are in planning or underway. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) may provide a noninvasive method to stimulate cortex. Controlled studies of TMS are split on efficacy, which may depend on whether a seizure focus is near a possible region for stimulation. Seizure detection devices in the form of shake detectors via portable accelerometers can provide notification of an ongoing tonic-clonic seizure, or peace of mind in the absence of notification. Prediction of seizures from various aspects of electroencephalography (EEG) is in early stages. Prediction appears to be possible in a subpopulation of people with refractory seizures, and a clinical trial of an implantable prediction device is underway. Cooling of neocortex or hippocampus reversibly can attenuate epileptiform EEG activity and seizures, but engineering problems remain in its implementation. Optogenetics is a new technique that can control excitability of specific populations of neurons with light. Inhibition of epileptiform activity has been demonstrated in hippocampal slices, but use in humans will require more work. In general, devices provide useful palliation for otherwise uncontrollable seizures, but with a different risk profile than with most drugs. Optimizing the place of devices in therapy for epilepsy will require further development and clinical experience.},

abstract = {Applied M ple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences (3rd ed.). Mah NJ: Erlbaum, 2003, 728 pp., {\$}65. The previous editions of this book, written by the first two authors, Jacob Patricia Cohen, became essential reference tools for many social scientists needed a solid grounding in statistical methodology. It was first published in with an intention to provide a foundation in the regression framework for the tical researcher. The second edition (1983) focused on causality and analysis variance and covariance. The third edition is even more extensive, containing topics that have evolved over the last 20 years, and has extensions of earlier ters. It remains as vital as ever. The expansion of the book was greatly aided by Leona Aiken and Stephen West, whose expertise on interactions and longitudinal studies helped build some of the new chapters. Jacob Cohen died in 1998, but his contributions and direction of focus for this edition still show the indispensability of his thinking for social scientists. Some readers may be disappointed that the focus is almost completely on regres-sion analyses, with barely a mention of analysis of variance. However, Jacob Cohen was a leading proponent of bringing separate data analysis frameworks within more unified, general frameworks. He also pushed for de-emphasizing classical hypo-thesis testing with significance values, but many of the examples carried over from the previous edition still retain this format. These are examples of shifts that are indicative of the direction statistical analysis has taken in the last few years. From their choice of topics to include and to discontinue, the authors' assessment of cur-rent trends in statistical analysis seems to have been on the mark. Although Jacob Cohen's thinking and style will be missed, his coauthors will surely carry on this enterprise. Their success in this edition has us looking forward to the fourth edition. The changes from the previous edition are numerous, resulting in a version that, although bearing a great resemblance to its predecessor, is richer with greater breadth and elaborated issues. Many topics have been updated to reflect recent developments in applied statistical analysis and are usually explained in detail. Nevertheless, readers will find that this still leaves quite a few topics undeveloped. Hence, two levels of exposition become apparent. There are detailed accounts where the theory is supplemented by examples and methodological instruction. 227 This content downloaded from 162.129.251.102 on Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:33:17 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms},

abstract = {Synchronization of local and distributed neuronal assemblies is thought to underlie fundamental brain processes such as perception, learning, and cognition. In neurological disease, neuronal synchrony can be altered and in epilepsy may play an important role in the generation of seizures. Linear cross-correlation and mean phase coherence of local field potentials (LFPs) are commonly used measures of neuronal synchrony and have been studied extensively in epileptic brain. Multiple studies have reported that epileptic brain is characterized by increased neuronal synchrony except possibly prior to seizure onset when synchrony may decrease. Previous studies using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), however, have been limited to patients with epilepsy. Here we investigate neuronal synchrony in epileptic and control brain using intracranial EEG recordings from patients with medically resistant partial epilepsy and control subjects with intractable facial pain. For both epilepsy and control patients, average LFP synchrony decreases with increasing interelectrode distance. Results in epilepsy patients show lower LFP synchrony between seizure-generating brain and other brain regions. This relative isolation of seizure-generating brain underlies the paradoxical finding that control patients without epilepsy have greater average LFP synchrony than patients with epilepsy. In conclusion, we show that in patients with focal epilepsy, the region of epileptic brain generating seizures is functionally isolated from surrounding brain regions. We further speculate that this functional isolation may contribute to spontaneous seizure generation and may represent a clinically useful electrophysiological signature for mapping epileptic brain.},

abstract = {The disease epilepsy is related to hypersynchronous activity of networks of neurons. While acute epileptic seizures are the most extreme manifestation of this hypersynchronous activity, an elevated level of interdependence of neuronal dynamics is thought to persist also during the seizure-free interval. In multichannel recordings from brain areas involved in the epileptic process, this interdependence can be reflected in an increased linear cross correlation but also in signal properties of higher order. Bivariate time series analysis comprises a variety of approaches, each with different degrees of sensitivity and specificity for interdependencies reflected in lower- or higher-order properties of pairs of simultaneously recorded signals. Here we investigate which approach is best suited to detect putatively elevated interdependence levels in signals recorded from brain areas involved in the epileptic process. For this purpose, we use the linear cross correlation that is sensitive to lower-order signatures of interdependence, a nonlinear interdependence measure that integrates both lower- and higher-order properties, and a surrogate-corrected nonlinear interdependence measure that aims to specifically characterize higher-order properties. We analyze intracranial electroencephalographic recordings of the seizure-free interval from 29 patients with an epileptic focus located in the medial temporal lobe. Our results show that all three approaches detect higher levels of interdependence for signals recorded from the brain hemisphere containing the epileptic focus as compared to signals recorded from the opposite hemisphere. For the linear cross correlation, however, these differences are not significant. For the nonlinear interdependence measure, results are significant but only of moderate accuracy with regard to the discriminative power for the focal and nonfocal hemispheres. The highest significance and accuracy is obtained for the surrogate-corrected nonlinear interdependence measure.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate whether functional brain networks of epilepsy patients treated with antiepileptic medication differ from networks of healthy controls even during the seizure-free interval. Methods: We applied different rules to construct binary and weighted networks from EEG and MEG data recorded under a resting-state eyes-open and eyes-closed condition from 21 epilepsy patients and 23 healthy controls. The average shortest path length and the clustering coefficient served as global statistical network characteristics. Results: Independent on the behavioral condition, epileptic brains exhibited a more regular functional network structure. Similarly, the eyes-closed condition was characterized by a more regular functional network structure in both groups. The amount of network reorganization due to behavioral state changes was similar in both groups. Consistent findings could be achieved for networks derived from EEG but hardly from MEG recordings, and network construction rules had a rather strong impact on our findings. Conclusions: Despite the locality of the investigated processes epileptic brain networks differ in their global characteristics from non-epileptic brain networks. Further methodological developments are necessary to improve the characterization of disturbed and normal functional networks. Significance: An increased regularity and a diminished modulation capability appear characteristic of epileptic brain networks. ?? 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Purpose: To analyze and compare spectral properties and interdependencies of intracerebral EEG signals recorded during interictal periods from mesial temporal lobe structures in two groups of epileptic patients defined according to the involvement of these structures in the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Methods: Interictal EEG activity in mesial temporal lobe (MTL) structures (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala) was obtained from intracerebral recordings performed in 21 patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE group). This group was compared with a "control" group of patients (non-MTLE group) in whom depth-EEG recordings of MTL show that seizures did not start from the MTL. Comparison criteria were based on spectral properties and statistical coupling (nonlinear correlation coefficient h2) of MTL signals. Results: Power spectral density analysis showed a significant decrease in the theta frequency sub-band (p = 0.01) in the MTLE group. Nonlinear correlation (h2) values were found to be higher in the MTLE group than in the NMTLE group (p = 0.0014). This effect was significant for theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies. Correlation values were not correlated with the frequency of interictal spikes (IS) and significant differences between groups were still measureable even when spikes were suppressed from analyzed EEG periods. Discussion: This study shows that, during the interictal state, the EZ in MTLE is characterized by a decrease of oscillations in the theta sub-band and by a general increase of signal interdependencies. This last finding suggests that the EZ is characterized by network of neuronal assemblies with a reinforced functional connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We explored various linear and nonlinear methods to detect weak synchronization in this network, using cross-correlation, mutual information in one and two dimensions, and phase correlation in both broad and narrow band. The linear and nonlinear methods demonstrated different patterns of sensitivity to detect synchrony in this network, depending on the dynamical state of the network. Bursts in 4-amino-pyridine (4AP) were highly synchronous events. Unexpectedly, seizure-like events in 4AP were desynchronous events, both in comparison with interictal periods preceding the seizure without bursts (cut Schaffer collateral tract) and in comparison with bursts preceding the seizures (intact Schaffer collateral tract). The finding that seizure-like events are associated with desynchronization in such networks is consistent with recent theoretical work, suggesting that asynchrony is necessary to maintain a high level of activity in neuronal networks for sustained periods of time and that synchrony may disrupt such activity.},

abstract = {Previous studies with intracranial recordings suggested that a more random spatial structure of functional brain networks could be related to seizure generation. Here, we studied whether similar network changes in weighted and unweighted networks can be found in generalized absence seizures recorded with surface EEG. We retrospectively selected EEG recordings of eleven children with absence seizures. The functional neural networks were characterized by calculating both coherence and synchronization likelihood (SL) between 21 EEG signals that were either broad band filtered (1-48 Hz) or filtered in different frequency bands. From both weighted and unweighted networks the clustering coefficient (C) and path length (L) were computed and compared to 500 random networks. We compared the ictal with the pre-ictal network structure. During absence seizures there was an increase of synchronization in all frequency bands, seen most clearly in the SL-based networks, and the functional network topology changed towards a more ordered pattern, with an increase of C/C-s and L/L-s. This study supports the hypothesis of functional neural network changes during absence seizures. The network became more regularized in weighted and unweighted analyses, when compared to the more randomized pre-ictal network configuration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objective: Neuronal networks with a so-called 'small-world' topography (characterized by strong clustering in combination with short path lengths) are known to facilitate synchronization, and possibly seizure generation. We tested the hypothesis that real functional brain networks during seizures display small-world features, using intracerebral recordings of mesial temporal lobe seizures. Methods: We used synchronization likelihood (SL) to characterize synchronization patterns in intracerebral EEG recordings of 7 patients for 5 periods of interest: interictal, before-, during- and after rapid discharges (in which the last two periods are ictal) and postictal. For each period, graphs (abstract network representations) were reconstructed from the synchronization matrix and characterized by a clustering coefficient C (measure of local connectedness) and a shortest path length L (measure of overall network integration). Results were also compared with those obtained from random networks. Results: The neuronal network changed during seizure activity, with an increase of C and L most prominent in the alpha, theta and delta frequency bands during and after the seizure. Conclusions: During seizures, the neuronal network moves in the direction of a more ordered configuration (higher C combined with a slightly, but significantly, higher L) compared to the more randomly organized interictal network, even after correcting for changes in synchronization strength.

abstract = {Neocortical seizures are often poorly localized, explosive and widespread at onset, making them poorly amenable to epilepsy surgery in the absence of associated focal brain lesions. We describe, for the first time in an unselected group of patients with neocortical epilepsy, the finding that high-frequency (60-100 Hz) epileptiform oscillations are highly localized in the seizure onset zone, both before and temporally removed from seizure onset. These findings were observed in all six patients with neocortical epilepsy out of 23 consecutive patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for pre-surgical evaluation during the study period. The majority of seizures (62{\%}) in these patients were anticipated by an increase in high-frequency activity in the 20 min prior to neocortical seizure onset. Contrary to observations in normal brain, high-frequency activity was strongly modulated by behavioural state, and was maximal during slow-wave sleep, which may explain the propensity for neocortical onset seizures to begin during sleep. These findings point to an important role for neuromodulatory circuits, probably involving the thalamus, in mechanisms underlying seizure generation in neocortical epilepsy. These findings demonstrate that high-frequency epileptiform oscillations may prove clinically useful in localizing the seizure onset zone in neocortical epilepsy, for identifying periods of increased probability of seizure onset, and in elucidating mechanisms underlying neocortical ictogenesis. Confirmation that prolonged bursts of high-frequency activity may predict focal onset neocortical seizures will require prospective validation on continuous, prolonged recordings in a larger number of patients. Importantly, the results show that the dynamic range utilized in current clinical practice for localization of epileptogenic brain largely ignores fundamental oscillations that are signatures of an epileptogenic brain. It may prove that many currently available clinical EEG systems and EEG analysis methods utilize a dynamic range that discards clinically important information.},

abstract = {Discrete high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the range of 100-500 Hz have previously been recorded in human epileptic brains using depth microelectrodes. We describe for the first time similar oscillations in a cohort of unselected focal epileptic patients implanted with EEG macroelectrodes. Spectral analysis and visual inspection techniques were used to study seizures from 10 consecutive patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for medically refractory focal epilepsy. Four of these patients had focal seizure onset in the mesial temporal lobe, and in all 12 of their seizures, well-localized, segmental, very high frequency band (VHF: 250-500 Hz) oscillations were visually identified near the time of seizure onset from contacts in this zone. Increased high-frequency band (HF: 100-200 Hz) activity compared with the background was distinguished both visually and with spectral analysis later in the seizures of 3/4 mesial temporal patients, involving contacts in the generator region and, in one patient, areas of contralateral peri-hippocampal propagation. Three patients with well-defined neocortical seizure-onset areas also demonstrated focal HF or VHF oscillations confined to the seizure-onset channels during their eight seizures. No discrete HF or VHF activity was present in the poorly localized seizures from the remaining three patients. These results show that discrete HFOs can be recorded from human focal epileptic brain using depth macroelectrodes, and that they occur mostly in regions of primary epileptogenesis and rarely in regions of secondary spread. Absent high-frequency activity seems to indicate poor localization, whereas the presence of focal HFOs near the time of seizure onset may signify proximity to the epileptogenic focus in mesial temporal lobe and neocortical seizures. We postulate that focal HFOs recorded with depth macroelectrodes reflect the partial synchronization of very local oscillations such as those previously studied using microelectrodes, and result from interconnected small neuronal ensembles. Our finding that localized HFOs occur in varying anatomical structures and pathological conditions perhaps indicates commonality to diverse epileptogenic aetiologies.},

abstract = {We present a method for the automatic comparison of epileptic seizures in EEG, allowing the grouping of seizures having similar overall patterns. Each channel of the EEG is first broken down into segments having relatively stationary characteristics. Features are then calculated for each segment and all segments of all channels of the seizures of one patient are grouped into clusters of similar morphology. This clustering allows labeling of every EEG segment. Methods derived from string matching procedures are then used to obtain an overall edit distance between two seizures, a distance that represents how the two seizures, taken in their entirety and including the channels not actually involved in the discharge, resemble each other. Examples from 5 patients, 3 with intracerebral electrodes and two with scalp electrodes, illustrate the ability of the method to group seizures of similar morphology.},

abstract = {Transfer entropy ( TE) is a recently proposed measure of the information flow between coupled linear or nonlinear systems. In this study, we suggest improvements in the selection of parameters for the estimation of TE that significantly enhance its accuracy and robustness in identifying the direction and the level of information flow between observed data series generated by coupled complex systems. We show the application of the improved TE method to long (in the order of days; approximately a total of 600 h across all patients), continuous, intracranial electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded in two different medical centers from four patients with focal temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) for localization of their foci. All patients underwent ablative surgery of their clinically assessed foci. Based on a surrogate statistical analysis of the TE results, it is shown that the identified potential focal sites through the suggested analysis were in agreement with the clinically assessed sites of the epileptogenic focus in all patients analyzed. It is noteworthy that the analysis was conducted on the available whole-duration multielectrode EEG, that is, without any subjective prior selection of EEG segments or electrodes for analysis. The above, in conjunction with the use of surrogate data, make the results of this analysis robust. These findings suggest a critical role TE may play in epilepsy research in general, and as a tool for robust localization of the epileptogenic focus/foci in patients with focal epilepsy in particular.},

abstract = {Small time differences between the EEG activities of two channels were measured by a method based on the use of coherence and phase spectra over a certain frequency range. In many cases this method allowed to establish that time differences of the order of 5-50 msec were actually present between two channels which appeared synchronous on visual inspection. The method was applied to seizure activity from the penicillin and kindling models in the cat and to seizures recorded from scalp and intracerebral electrodes in epileptic patients. When the seizure activity was widespread but was known to be related to an epileptic focus, it was found that the area of the focus had a consistent time lead over the other recording sites. It was concluded that the method could frequently allow to: (1) assess the presence of an epileptic focus even when only widespread seizure activity could be recorded; (2) make inferences about the possible routes of propagation of seizure activity. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {Many networks of interest in the sciences, including a variety of social and biological networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure has attracted considerable recent attention. One of the most sensitive detection methods is optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network, but direct application of this method using, for instance, simulated annealing is computationally costly. Here we show that the modularity can be reformulated in terms of the eigenvectors of a new characteristic matrix for the network, which we call the modularity matrix, and that this reformulation leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of better quality than competing methods in noticeably shorter running times. We demonstrate the algorithm with applications to several network data sets.},

abstract = {Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide, and seizures in 30{\%} of the cases remain drug resistant. This has increased interest in responsive neurostimulation, which is most effective when administered during seizure onset. We propose a novel framework for seizure onset detection that involves (i) constructing statistics from multichannel intracranial EEG (iEEG) to distinguish nonictal versus ictal states; (ii) modeling the dynamics of these statistics in each state and the state transitions; you can remove this word if there is no room. (iii) developing an optimal control-based "quickest detection" (QD) strategy to estimate the transition times from nonictal to ictal states from sequential iEEG measurements. The QD strategy minimizes a cost function of detection delay and false positive probability. The solution is a threshold that non-monotonically decreases over time and avoids responding to rare events that normally trigger false positives. We applied QD to four drug resistant epileptic patients (168 hour continuous recordings, 26-44 electrodes, 33 seizures) and achieved 100{\%} sensitivity with low false positive rates (0.16 false positive/hour).

Possible reasons for the recent expansion in epilepsy surgery in the so-called developed countries include the availability of advanced non-invasive diagnostic tools to delineate epileptogenic lesions and epilepsy-related functional deficits, and to prove 'epileptogenicity'. Improved surgical techniques are, however, equally important. This translates into better postsurgical outcome figures and into a larger population of difficult-to-treat patients profiting from surgical therapy. There is, also, an important role for epilepsy surgery within the modern neuroscience field. A critical review and analysis of the present state-of-the-art epilepsy surgery is presented and possible scenarios for its future development are outlined. Within this framework the conceptual differentiation of epilepsy surgery into three categories-'lesion-oriented surgery', 'epilepsy-oriented lesional surgery' and 'epilepsy surgery sensu stricto'-is maintained, since it is relevant to the organization of epilepsy centres. The growing need for quality control and multidisciplinary and worldwide collaboration is emphasized.},

abstract = {Summary: Patients with neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy (NTLE) may have less favorable outcome with anterior temporal lobectomy than those with mesial temporal foci. The authors analyzed ictal intracranial electroencephalograms (EEGs) in patients with NTLE to identify features that predict surgical outcome. The following intracranial ictal EEG features in 31 consecutive medically intractable NTLE patients were studied: Frequency (i.e., low-voltage fast [{\textgreater}20 Hz], recruiting ictal-onset spikes, ictal-onset rhythms less than 5 Hz, ictal-onset rhythms with repetitive sharp waves between 5 and 20 Hz); extent of ictal onset (focal, sublobar, and lobar); localization within the temporal lobe (anterior, posterior, or regional); and the time to seizure spread outside the temporal lobe (rapid, intermediate, and slow). The average follow-up period was 36.7 months (range, 18 to 60 months). Findings between two outcome groups were compared: class I group (seizure-free) and class II to IV group (persistent seizures). Twenty-one (66.7{\%}) of 31 patients with NTLE were seizure-free. Intracranial EEG features which were significantly associated with seizure-free outcome were focal or sublobar onset, anterior temporal onset, and slow propagation time (P{\textless} 0.05). There was a trend for patients with ictal onset morphologies of slow ictal-onset rhythm and repetitive sharp waves to be seizure-free (P= 0.07). Intracranial EEG is helpful in predicting surgical outcome in NTLE patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) enables precise recordings from deep cortical structures, multiple noncontiguous lobes, as well as bilateral explorations while avoiding large craniotomies. Despite a long reported successful record, its application in the United States has not been widely adopted. We report on our initial experience with the SEEG methodology in the extraoperative mapping of refractory focal epilepsy in patients who were not considered optimal surgical candidates for other methods of invasive monitoring. We focused on the applied surgical technique and its utility and efficacy in this subgroup of patients. METHODS Between March 2009 and May 2011, 100 patients with the diagnosis of medically refractory focal epilepsy who were not considered optimal candidates for subdural grids and strips placement underwent SEEG implantation at Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center. Demographics, noninvasive clinical data, number and location of implanted electrodes, electrophysiologic localization of the epileptic zone, complications, and short-term seizure outcome after resection were prospectively collected and analyzed. KEY FINDINGS Mean age was 32 years (range 5-68 years); 54 were male and 46 female. The mean follow-up after resection was 15 months. In total, 1,310 electrodes were implanted. Analyses of the SEEG recordings resulted in the electrographic localization of the epileptogenic focus in 96 patients. In the group of 75 patients who underwent resection, only 53 had at least 12 months follow-up. From this group, 33 patients (62.3{\%}) were seizure-free at the end of the follow-up period. The presence of abnormal pathologic finding was strongly associated with postoperative seizure control (p = 0.005). The risk of hemorrhagic complications per electrode was 0.2{\%}. SIGNIFICANCE In patients who are not considered to be ideal candidates for subdural grids and strips implantation, the SEEG methodology is a safe, useful and reliable alternative option for invasive monitoring in patients with refractory focal epilepsy, providing an additional mean for seizure localization and control in a "difficult to localize" subgroup of patients.},

After subdural grid monitoring and identification of the epileptic regions, cortical excisions and/or multiple subpial transections (MSTs) were performed. Complications after these procedures were then categorized as either surgical or neurological. There were 17 male and 18 female patients whose mean age was 11.7 years. The duration of epilepsy before surgery ranged from 2 to 17 years (mean 8.3 years). Fifteen children (43{\%}) had previously undergone surgical procedures for epilepsy. The number of electrodes on the grids ranged from 40 to 117 (mean 95). During invasive video EEG, cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred in seven patients. Also, cerebral edema (five patients), subdural hematoma (five patients), and intracerebral hematoma (three patients) were observed on postprocedural imaging studies but did not require surgical intervention. Hypertrophic scars on the scalp were observed in nine patients. There were three infections, including one case of osteomyelitis and two superficial wound infections. Blood loss and the amounts of subsequent transfusions correlated directly with the size and number of electrodes on the grids (p {\textless} 0.001). Twenty-eight children derived significant benefit from cortical resections and MSTs, with a more than 50{\%} reduction of seizures and a mean follow-up period of 30 months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that carefully selected pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy can benefit from subdural invasive monitoring procedures that entail definite but acceptable risks.},

abstract = {Subdural electrodes play a very important role in the evaluation of a percentage of patients being considered for epilepsy surgery. Electrical activity at very low and very high frequencies, beyond the practical range of scalp EEG, can be recorded subdurally and may contain considerable information not available non-invasively. The recording and stimulating procedures for using chronically implanted subdural electrodes to localize the epileptogenic zone and map eloquent functions of the human cortex are well established, and complication rates are low. Complications include infections, CSF leak, and focal neurologic deficits, all of which tend to be increased with a higher number of electrodes and longer duration of recordings. Careful consideration of the risks and benefits should be coupled with a firm hypothesis about the epileptogenic zone derived from the non-invasive components of the epilepsy workup to guide the decision about whether and where to implant subdural electrodes. When they are employed to answer a specific question in an individual patient, subdural electrodes can optimize the clinical outcome of a candidate for epilepsy surgery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) guided by subdural EEG generally have a poor surgical outcome. Our objective was to identify predictors of postoperative seizure recurrence in this patient cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 48 consecutive surgeries guided by subdural electrode recordings between 1990 and 2004 in patients with a pathologic diagnosis of isolated FCD. Using survival analysis, we analyzed results of the noninvasive evaluation, MRI, subdural interictal and ictal EEG patterns, extent of resection, proximity to eloquent cortex, and postoperative EEG. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 2.7 years, 45{\%} of patients were completely seizure-free. Most seizures recurred in the first 6 months or between years 2 and 3 after surgery. On univariate analysis, seizure recurrence was associated with bilateral EEG abnormalities, multiple semiologic seizure types, and incomplete resection of the ictal onset zone. The absence of an MRI lesion did not affect outcome, nor did proximity to eloquent cortex. Interictal paroxysmal fast and runs of repetitive spikes correlated with the ictal onset zone, whereas isolated spikes did not. The 6-month EEG predicted ultimate surgical failure in patients seizure-free at that stage. An ictal spread pattern from the edge of the subdural grids was an independent predictor of seizure recurrence on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified specific predictive factors that may guide the surgical evaluation of patients with focal cortical dysplasia and intractable epilepsy requiring subdural EEG monitoring. Successful surgical results can be obtained utilizing subdural EEG in carefully selected patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Whether an epileptic lesion is detected with MR imaging depends on the quality of the images and the expertise of the reader. We analyzed the role of 1.5-T MR imaging in the presurgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy at one center. METHODS In a 2-year prospective study, 385 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy underwent standardized MR imaging at 1.5 T. We analyzed whether lesions were detected, whether they were precisely characterized by MR imaging, and whether lesion characterization allowed us to estimate seizure outcomes. RESULTS Lesions were found on MR images in 318 patients (83{\%}). Following presurgical evaluation, 209 (66{\%}) underwent surgery, and 109 (34{\%}) did not. Freedom from seizures was achieved in 130 (70{\%}) of 186 patients. Nine (14{\%}) of 66 patients without an MR imaging lesion underwent surgery; histopathologic findings were unrevealing in seven patients, and five (56{\%}) achieved freedom from seizures. Hippocampal sclerosis was the most common lesion (52{\%}) and correctly characterized in 101 (97{\%}) of 104 patients. Glioneuronal tumors (20{\%}) were sometimes imprecisely characterized: Four nonenhancing gangliogliomas were mistaken for focal cortical dysplasias. Outcomes were not different between lesion groups. However, there were trends toward a favorable outcome for focal cortical dysplasias with balloon cells and an unfavorable outcome for gyral scars. CONCLUSION MR imaging detection of lesions influences further presurgical workup, though lesion characterization does not allow us to predict seizure outcome. If MR imaging fails to depict a lesion and patients undergo surgery because of electrophysiologic findings, histopathologic findings are often unrevealing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery is an important therapeutic option in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The combination of an extratemporal epileptic focus and nonlesional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was often believed to portend a poor outcome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome and analyze potential prognostic predictors in patients without lesions on MRI who underwent extratemporal resections.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Clinical, presurgical evaluation, invasive monitoring, and postoperative data of patients with high-resolution MRI that was initially reported as nonlesional were reviewed. Patients were reclassified as MRI-positive if an MRI abnormality related to the epilepsy was revealed at the multidisciplinary presurgical patient management conference, or as MRI-negative if imaging remained normal or revealed incidental findings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sixty patients were identified; 72{\%} were MRI-negative. In the original cohort, the median seizure-free duration was 1.32 years (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.16-2.0); probability of seizure freedom at 2 years was 36{\%} (95{\%} CI, 30{\%}-43{\%}). In the MRI-negative group, the median seizure-free duration was 1.52 years (95{\%} CI, 0.12-5.17); probability of seizure freedom at 2 years was 42{\%} (95{\%} CI, 33{\%}-50{\%}). Complete resection of ictal onset areas and absence of acute postoperative seizures were significantly associated with longer seizure freedom (risk ratio 4.9, P = .004; 95{\%} CI, 1.6-16.7 and 22.1, P {\textless} .001; 95{\%} CI, 5.9-94.7, respectively).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Among patients with medically refractory MRI nonlesional extratemporal epilepsy, detailed evaluation and subsequent resection leads to seizure freedom in 42{\%} of patients at 2 years.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide 1995 estimates of the lifetime and annual cost of epilepsy in the United States using data from patients with epilepsy, and adjusting for the effects of comorbidities and socioeconomic conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Direct treatment-related costs of epilepsy from onset through 6 years were derived from billing and medical chart data for 608 population-based incident cases at two sites in different regions of the country. Indirect productivity-related costs were derived from a survey of 1,168 adult patients visiting regional treatment centers. Direct costs separate the effects of epilepsy and comorbidity conditions. Indirect costs account for the effects of other disabilities and socioeconomic conditions on foregone earnings and household activity. The estimates were applied to 1995 population figures to derive national projections of the lifetime and annual costs of the disorder.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The lifetime cost of epilepsy for an estimated 181,000 people with onset in 1995 is projected at {\$}11.1 billion, and the annual cost for the estimated 2.3 million prevalent cases is estimated at {\$}12.5 billion. Indirect costs account for 85{\%} of the total and, with direct costs, are concentrated in people with intractable epilepsy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Direct costs attributable to epilepsy are below previous estimates. Indirect costs adjusted for the socioeconomic conditions of patients are above previous estimates. Findings indicate that epilepsy is unique in the large proportion of costs that are productivity-related, justifying further investment in the development of effective interventions.},

abstract = {The impact of epilepsy is not limited to the child experiencing seizures, but affects all members of the family. As primary caregivers, mothers are particularly at risk for experiencing increased depressive symptoms and risk for clinical depression. The objective of this systematic review was to critically assess available evidence regarding the prevalence, associated factors, and impact of maternal depressive symptoms on child outcomes in epilepsy. Using a modified version of the Quality Index, studies were rigorously evaluated in terms of reporting, external validity, and internal validity. Limitations in the study designs and analytic techniques of previous research are discussed, and study methods to overcome these barriers are presented in order to advance this research area. Up to 50{\%} of mothers of children with epilepsy are at risk for clinical depression. Correlates of maternal depressive symptoms include a number of modifiable risk factors such as role ambiguity, worry, and satisfaction with relationships. In addition, studies suggest that depressive symptoms in mothers have a negative impact on child outcomes in epilepsy including behavior problems and health-related quality of life. The overall mean score on the Quality Index was 9.7, indicating a midrange quality score, suggesting a need for more methodologically robust studies.},

abstract = {Localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is essential for the successful surgical treatment of medically intractable epilepsy. In the present study, stereo-EEG (SEEG) recordings were obtained from seven patients underwent presurgical evaluation for treatment of intractable epilepsy. Partial directed coherence (PDC) analysis was applied to construct peri-ictal effective connectivity networks. The graphic measures, in-degree, out-degree and betweenness centrality, were evaluated to localize the EZ. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to quantify the localization accuracy. We found that the in-degree coincided well with the EZ identified by epileptologists' visual inspection in all seven patients who had a significant improvement in seizure outcomes, however, the other two measures were effective only in some cases. Furthermore, in all seven patients the electrode contact with the highest in-degree was always located within the EZ identified by epileptologists' visual inspection. These results indicate that the graph theory is an effective method to localize the EZ when suitable graphic measures were chosen. Furthermore, the in-degree was the most effective measure among the three graphic measures in localizing the EZ when the PDC method was used.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is a network phenomenon characterized by atypical activity during seizure both at the level of single neurons and neural populations. The etiology of epilepsy is not completely understood but a common theme among proposed mechanisms is abnormal synchronization between neuronal populations. Recent advances in novel imaging and recording technologies have enabled the inference of comprehensive maps of both the anatomical and physiological inter-relationships between brain regions. Clinical protocols established for diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy utilize both advanced neuroimaging techniques and neurophysiological data. These growing clinical datasets can be further exploited to better understand the complex connectivity patterns in the epileptic brain. In this article, we review results and insights gained from the growing body of research focused on epilepsy from a network perspective. In particular, we put an emphasis on two different notions of network connectivity: functional and effective; and studies investigating these notions in epilepsy are highlighted. We also discuss limitations and opportunities in data collection and analyses that will further our understanding of epileptic networks and the mechanisms of seizures.},

abstract = {We derive a synaptic weight update rule for learning temporally precise spike train to spike train transformations in multilayer feedforward networks of spiking neurons. The framework, aimed at seamlessly generalizing error backpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron setting, is based strictly on spike timing and avoids invoking concepts pertaining to spike rates or probabilistic models of spiking. The derivation is founded on two innovations. First, an error functional is proposed that compares the spike train emitted by the output neuron of the network to the desired spike train by way of their putative impact on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps the need for spike alignment and leads to closed form solutions for all quantities of interest. Second, virtual assignment of weights to spikes rather than synapses enables a perturbation analysis of individual spike times and synaptic weights of the output as well as all intermediate neurons in the network, which yields the gradients of the error functional with respect to the said entities. Learning proceeds via a gradient descent mechanism that leverages these quantities. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed learning framework. The experiments also highlight asymmetries between synapses on excitatory and inhibitory neurons.},
