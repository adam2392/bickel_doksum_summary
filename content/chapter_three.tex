\section{Chapter 3: Measure of Performance and "Notions" of Optimality in Estimation Procedures}
	
	In general, there is a random variable of interest $X ~ P \in \mathbb{P} = \{P_\theta : \theta \in \Theta \}$. Now, we want to estimate $\theta$ in some reasonable manner with functions $\hat{\theta}$ based on the vector of observations, X. Our goal is to make this estimator somehow close to the true $\theta$.
